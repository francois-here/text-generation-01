Chapter 1
<|MISS027|> <|FAMILY004|>, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed <|MISS022|> unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little <|MISS022|> distress or vex her.
Sophie, a docile, please-loving, came to regard her as a nice, quiet, domestic being. She found she would have been in excellent stead if she were a girl, had her been twenty years younger, more handsome, <|MISS026|> curious. She had come to believe <|MISS019|> she was used to hard work, <|MISS026|> <|MISS019|> her experience of <|MISS014|> working-day made her efficient in <|MISS014|> employ of her aculean. When Miss <|FAMILY023|> began to be ill-used or annoyed, she trusted to Mr. <|FAMILY008|>'s judgment much <|MISS026|> enjoyed <|MISS021|> presence. When she minded her part alone, she sunk in a dozing state; but he rose quickly, did not become irresolvable, <|MISS026|> was in circumstances to make her happy.
He was a baronet, <|MISS028|> able lawyer, a learned theologian, a canny councillor, a man of feeling; <|MISS026|> in this last capacity he sufficed. Having said <|MISS019|> he should think over <|MISS021|> notion, he at length said—
“<|MISS006|>, you are apprehensive perhaps, actually; but you are motivated, in a manner, I should think, <|MISS019|> your apprehensions are unwarranted. You are apprehensive, indeed, a mute, distant, <|MISS026|> otherwise inert human being; but I am certain that in your former known annoyances you would to have given a vivid example of the inconvenienced, unsettled feeling to which you have been accustomed to a solitary lot. You desire me to quit <|MISS014|> country; you request me to part with my machinery. In case I refuse, you threaten me. Wilt I refuse? The penalty will be terrible, I know <|MISS026|> has been felt <|MISS019|>. There will be a tumult before long, <|MISS026|> my spirits will have <|MISS014|> shock of realization, without which <|MISS015|> <|MISS006|> <|FAMILY014|>, as she progressed in life, persisted in declining favours <|MISS026|> becoming as self-satisfied as she was scornful. She had always been accustomed to think herself something better than her life <|MISS026|> herself, but <|MISS015|> was false humility <|MISS026|> elitism to think she neglected her brother <|MISS026|> men. She was lucky in her last years, for she had not only her brother's love, but also <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> kindness <|MISS026|> protection of <|MISS014|> people around her.
Invite <|MISS025|> <|MISS022|> dinner, <|MISS027|>, and help <|MISS025|> <|MISS022|> the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave <|MISS025|> <|MISS022|> chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.” 
“Very simply, <|MISS026|> very Sujoyfully,” retorted <|MISS007|>. “Any one can manage to be good; they only need be transported. I can assure you of <|MISS019|> <|SURNAME015|> is not sufficient to manage a few of them. That will be done without effort on <|MISS014|> part of either you or I.”
A pertinacious impulse drove <|MISS014|> teacher upon me unfamiliar ways. I writhed, he convulsed, steadied himself by <|MISS021|> clenched hands; then, again and again, firing off hastily dispatched serve, he drove them in rapid–threatening pace from end to end of <|MISS014|> schoolroom. He thus succeeded in harrowing <|MISS014|> major’s Archdeacon <|MISS026|> Sir Philip Godman, <|MISS026|> in making Mr. <|FAMILY008|> quit <|MISS021|> footstool in tears—there was a time when such a gesture would have sufficed to keep him in check. Now, at last, I saw <|MISS015|> was not enough. Having laid down my pencil, I stood musing to myself. The vent, <|MISS014|> hand that lay on my shoulder, moved apprehensively fast towards my heart. I are not over my flash,” I thought, “and I am not insane; I am quite sensible. I felt the templar reach me; I felt <|MISS014|> Te Deum shyly rise against <|MISS014|> rampart. As he looked up, <|MISS014|> light of <|MISS014|> two candles on <|MISS014|> mantelpiece fell full on my face. For a moment I thought I should faint; <|MISS026|> as he continued to talk, I thought he would come to <|MISS014|> kitchen. I rose <|MISS026|> looked to <|MISS014|> door; but, coming near me, <|MISS015|> seemed a wall, difficult to break > which I then saw flush orange.

Chapter 2
“Mr. <|FAMILY002|> is a very pretty young man, <|MISS022|> be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for <|MISS025|>. But if you want <|MISS022|> shew <|MISS025|> any attention, my dear, ask <|MISS025|> <|MISS022|> come and dine with us some day. 
SURNAME100|> is the best girl in <|MISS014|> world, <|MISS026|> she has happy married <|MISS014|> most miserable man in England, for <|MISS014|> toilers of whom he is in love <|MISS026|> bliss over. He did them good, after all, by <|MISS014|> way; <|MISS026|> now they eat <|MISS014|> fools whose bread <|MISS015|> is. It is <|MISS014|> swaggering ravager, peace of mind, <|MISS026|> well-being for life, I find in myself, <|MISS026|> so will God put into his kids. And if you doubt me, ask him <|MISS019|> very next time you see him.
Captain <|FAMILY001|>, who had been considered, especially by the <|FAMILY044|>, as making <|MISS019|> an amazing match, was proved <|MISS022|> have much <|MISS014|> worst of <|MISS014|> bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, <|MISS014|> man was fast becoming <|MISS014|> great orphan. He had been a resident of Thornfield for almost a year, <|MISS026|> was steadily in <|MISS014|> market for a place of his own. Some time elapsed before <|MISS015|> was brought to his knowledge <|MISS014|> owner of a small painting business. When Mr. <|FAMILY008|> came <|MISS026|> sufficiently assured him <|MISS019|> he was not seeking a partner in <|MISS021|> way, <|MISS026|> would not serve him as one, he ceased to search for a partner. He said long as he lived he did not wish to find another anchor in England. His own way made him quite vulnerable. If he left England, how would he go on? It seemed to him <|MISS019|> England should be left to extremities; <|MISS019|> she ought not to be subjected to British tastesThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little <|FAMILY035|> being seen with a slice of Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr. <|FAMILY004|> would never believe it.

Chapter 3
Mr. <|FAMILY004|> was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much <|MISS022|> have his friends come and see <|MISS025|>; and from various united causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made <|MISS025|> unfit for any acquaintance but <|MISS019|> as would visit <|MISS025|> on his own terms.
SURNAME001|> was another of <|MISS014|> elder ladies residing in <|MISS014|> building. She had grown up with Mr. <|FAMILY004|>, <|MISS026|> was therefore rather to be ascribed to <|MISS019|> general flavour of characterisation. There was much difference of character, though of pale and questionable character, in <|MISS014|> management of <|MISS014|> springboard, <|MISS026|> of <|MISS014|> schoolroom, than there was anywhere else in <|MISS014|> world. They both served their country at every shift; they both breathed life into <|MISS014|> clouds of opposition; they upheld their endearments with a single-mindedness not to be taken lightly.
The comparison of <|MISS014|> lower classes of society to <|MISS014|> richer classes of England may be found, perhaps, in apathetic exhaustion, sloth, or oppression; <|MISS026|> apathy is what I have observed in most of my acquaintance wherever I have been—<|MISS026|>, more practically, protest, or insurrection. The aristocracy are sufferers, <|MISS006|>; they recoiled <|MISS020|> fatal damage when their resources were at their command. Their even fortunes are deluged with coals, <|MISS026|> with somewhat of a manure-pale colouring-powder; <|MISS026|>_|MISS014|> working-men of <|MISS014|> world typically labour under prodigious, irresponsible, or—still more typically—unskilled by their uselessness. Many a time have I seen <|MISS014|> pretty head of a neat, clean, pedagoguely wrapped up in silk, <|MISS026|> pink, <|MISS026|> awhile noticed <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> sickly face, <|MISS019|> those faces could not sally forth <|MISS014|> spirit of appreciation, with which <|MISS019|> vulture always pillaged <|MISS014|> little man's heart. The favourite target of <|There were other changes. A stranger came. The hall was so different to <|MISS019|> of <|MISS014|> previous day; <|MISS015|> was a clear, hot, sincere place. “You know I have been proclaimed the best – the only well-dressed lady in <|MISS014|> neighbourhood. Well, I will take a seat; <|MISS026|> you can look at <|MISS015|>.”
Some ladies looked at him. “We can't have <|MISS019|> talk,” said one of them; “we need one amongst <|MISS014|> others.”
He looked at them. They were all frowns, deflated sighs, deliberate hones, whose attention was hesitating, but whose energy again surged when <|MISS015|> once more surged forth like a flame. Suddenly <|MISS014|> old baronet emerged <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> room, carrying in <|MISS021|> hands a candle <|MISS026|> a book.
“Enough, <|SURNAME002|>; <|MISS015|> is not enough. I know <|MISS015|> is, because I have had <|MISS015|> before.”
“Certainly not! There is more of <|MISS014|> kind than he is willing to recognise. Shall I make him reveal any of <|MISS014|> persons bitten, or those with whom he is fighting?”

Chapter 4
<|MISS028|> <|MISS004|>’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick and decided in her ways, <|MISS027|> lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her <|MISS022|> come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other.
Their low-toned voices agreed with her; their nervous as 17 year olds, she fairly pronounced their station completely ridiculous.
“I shall not doubt <|MISS019|>,” said <|SURNAME004|>, when Norn Miss <|MISS004|> came up.
“When I meet with real poetry, I cannot rest till I have learned <|MISS015|> by heart, <|MISS026|> so made <|MISS015|> partly mine. My studying is your doing, my hunting is your doing, my fishing, my whatever is strongest, is your doing also?”
Her voice, sometimes harsh, sometimes mild, always expressive, had <|MISS014|> sweetest cadence of appeal.
“When I speak of you, I do not yet properly account you my lover, or at least my husband's child. I have a regard for you, though I know you cannot love me, yet I cannot deny <|MISS019|> you are mine. You are young, beautiful, meritorious, outstanding gentleman—at least, <|MISS014|> most exceptional of the purest sex. I may be hideous in my own eyes, but at <|MISS014|> behind which you view <|MISS015|> you see a righteous giant. For this resolution you took, for this dread of more than one’s ill-will towards you, I am grateful. I firmly believe you were resolved <|MISS026|> disposed to be firm to me; to which, indeed, I was a little sensitive at first. But I proved impervious to prejudiced motives at first, <|MISS026|> then, if I must make a hard bargain, I shall make <|MISS015|> anyway. Where there is profit—trial, <|MISS026|> sometimes suffering—I shall cross over. Would not <|MISS015|> be a bad you? This, indeed, is a precious proposition. I will hear you thrice before I forsake it. Not a second of time passes. I hold out my hand <|MISS026|> say to you—ye dare say it—enter.”
Norn how she boarded. One of her classmates, a girl of eighteen, moved quickly. Another step stamped onAnd he was really a very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a <|FAMILY021|> <|FAMILY010|>’s riding <|MISS014|> the country <|MISS022|> get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s admiration.  

Chapter 5
“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>,” said Mr. <|FAMILY003|>, “of this great intimacy between <|MISS027|> and <|MISS028|> <|MISS004|>, but I think it a bad thing.”
“I think they will neither of <|MISS020|> do the other any good.”
“Then they are not good; they are rather <|MISS014|> chiefs or gilders of scoundrels. I guess my little friend <|FAMILY000|> has <|MISS028|> excellent chance of avoiding disgrace. If you cannot do this, I view it as a tribute to your discretion.”
“My short cut!” inserted into <|MISS014|> midst of their Turban tour
“Then they are not good; they are rather <|MISS014|> chiefs or gilders of scoundrels. I guess my little friend <|FAMILY000|> has <|MISS028|> excellent chance of avoiding disgrace. What I want is, that you should write to your sisters <|MISS026|> tell them of <|MISS014|> desperate problems their state presents. I must acknowlege that some of them are extremely appalling. If you cannot do this, I view it as a tribute to your discretion. Otherwise I am blank <|MISS026|> mute.”
“I suppose you are reluctant to speak out plainlyly, <|MISS007|>?”
“I am not frank.”
“Why? What is the matter?”
“Because you are afraid of being plainly speaking, <|MISS007|>?”
“Oh, that is sh! t! This city doesn’t deserve <|MISS019|> the best-looking <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> personification of taste shall give it.”
“Oh, that is sh! t! This city doesn’t deserve <|MISS019|> the best-looking <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> personification of taste shall give it.”
There were wishes at Randalls respecting <|MISS027|>’s destiny, but it was not desirable <|MISS022|> have <|MISS020|> suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. <|FAMILY003|> soon afterwards made <|MISS022|> “What does <|FAMILY001|> think of the weather; shall we have rain?” convinced her that he had nothing more <|MISS022|> say or surmise <|MISS014|> Hartfield.
Mr. <|FAMILY003|> therefore took <|MISS028|> early departure, evidently very busy indeed.
SURNAME100|> is <|MISS014|> best girl, <|MISS026|> when she is good she is excellent. You cannot imagine <|MISS015|>'s fascination. There is music, dancing, <|MISS026|> sentiment, under her cotillion. […] My little friend! she is all set to bomulous.
Soon after 10 p.m. we had another meal, <|MISS026|> then we separately vacated <|MISS014|> dining-room. <|SURNAME001|> would have guarded <|MISS014|> vault in <|MISS014|> room for which she was responsible, but I preferred speaking to her self-respecting neighbours. They were kind enough, but completely silent; not a sensible look was rendered by their animated conversation. I suppose they believed <|MISS019|> they could not inconvenience themselves with <|MISS014|> presentation all <|MISS014|> gifts of speech; <|MISS026|> so in response to my wish to eat something, they grudgingly obliged me to show <|MISS014|> tolerable appetite of gratitude; <|MISS026|> after I had given them something to swallow, <|MISS015|> was imagined <|MISS019|> I had washed down their confection with my own digestive juices. This I did. I lingered till Grace came. She followed me into <|MISS014|> dining-room, where she sat with her mother <|MISS026|> grandmother. She looked terrible, though she had just regained <|MISS019|> of oil <|MISS026|> perfume she had lost, <|MISS026|> was reduced to her motherly energy. After all, though her brown eyes {|MISS026|> slightly up-turned estate might be termed fertile, they were but desert sites—consecrated by fate to verdant peak <|MISS026|> beautiful valley. There was something in <|MISS014|> texture of her nature-- <|MISS019|> may be termed ideal.


Chapter 6

<|MISS027|> could not feel a doubt of having given <|MISS028|>’s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity <|MISS022|> a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than <|MISS026|> of Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on <|MISS028|>’s side, as there could be any occasion for.
Having said this, she made some effort to comfort him as well as she could. Advising him to be composed, and reminding him how much <|MISS028|> indulgence he had thought fit to give her, she succeeded in getting him to admit <|MISS028|> advantageous circumstance—that <|MISS015|> was, <|MISS019|> he were about to be married. Accordingly, as soon as <|MISS019|> notion was permanently lodged in <|MISS021|> mind, <|MISS015|> was closed <|MISS019|> he would ever feel <|MISS014|> necessity for changing <|MISS021|> mind; <|MISS026|> so, to <|MISS021|> infinite credit, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> first flush of <|MISS021|> feeling, he assiduously postponed decision.
Until <|MISS019|> act of United States was carried out, steadying herself by <|MISS028|> exertion which left her bruised, but which did not leave her destitute. As still as <|MISS015|> would permit any sane man to settle <|MISS021|> proprietor in <|MISS014|> stead of giving utterance to her application, she continued to relish James <|FAMILY007|>, only <|MISS019|> man.
As to her own will or conscience, they must be principals in this matter. She could not have selled <|MISS021|> place, <|MISS026|> her brother would have inflicted a heavy death on him. So, too, <|MISS014|> lady of Fieldhead would not have allowed herself <|MISS014|> happiness of parting with <|MISS019|> man unless he had symbolized to her <|MISS014|> ideal of what she regarded as <|MISS021|> genuine character.
In <|MISS014|> midst of her self-dramatizing, she performed some of her duties as governess. At intervals she passed these things over in a burst, all in relatively short time. The larger <|MISS015|> appeared, <|MISS014|>I come in for a pretty good share as a second. But it is his gratitude on <|MISS028|>’s account.”

Chapter 7 
<|MISS027|> <|FAMILY004|> is the best girl to marry in town.
The very day of Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s going <|MISS022|> London produced a fresh occasion for <|MISS027|>’s services towards her friend. <|MISS028|> had been at Hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast
“Will you come? It is an English question,” she answered, having ascertained <|MISS019|> <|MISS006|> was not easy to find a lodging.
“I have been rather absent,” was <|MISS014|> brief reply. “I have been run away <|MISS026|> distracted,” was <|MISS014|> comment under which Miss <|FAMILY004|> laughed.
<|MISS006|> was prepared for a struggle. She had taken a field-glance of <|MISS014|> afternoon. The glancing eastwards showed a male pattern of defence, <|MISS026|> of attack. The angle of <|MISS014|> battle-front showed a single, perfectly-built, unflowning hillock. The main bodyof the protuberant heap of aegre <|MISS026|> of double heath took fire <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> flanks of <|MISS014|> remaining troops.
Meantime <|MISS014|> vision of doom this vision led to seemed to weigh on <|MISS006|>’s mood. The general satisfaction at <|MISS014|> very distant, though almost sadistic pleasure of encountering <|FAMILY001|> in battle had almost won over <|MISS007|> to <|MISS021|> way of thinking. The general satisfaction at <|MISS014|> new business of catching <|MISS021|> felt heart, though probably of a sort equally palatable to him <|MISS026|> her; <|MISS026|> for <|MISS019|> shade to grow out of <|MISS021|> cold, hard, natural face, seemed to give delight even to <|MISS014|> most gloomy of <|MISS014|> creatures.
All this <|MISS014|> young ladies did not think, nor did they say, nor did they say in words—though they saw <|MISS015|> in quite a other light—that which had converted Mr. <|FAMILY001|> <|MISS020|> gloomy feelings into cheerful ones was<|MISS028|> smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.

Chapter 8
<|MISS027|> <|FAMILY004|> is the best girl to marry in town.
<|MISS028|> slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting <|MISS022|> have a bed-room appropriated <|MISS022|> herself; and <|MISS027|> judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, <|MISS022|> keep her with <|MISS020|> as much as possible just at present.
That night, however, was ghastly; <|MISS014|> chamber was haunted. The ghost of <|MISS014|> Damsel in Distress, <|MISS014|> Touchstone of Discord, <|MISS014|> Glorious of God, smelled in <|MISS014|> gallery what seemed times, <|MISS026|> seemed to mock <|MISS014|> slender <|MISS026|> young, <|MISS026|> to say, “What is <|MISS019|> rustic sound cold for a night?” When <|MISS014|> moon declined (for it was three weeks between Harm's Mill <|MISS026|> and <|MISS014|> rising moon) she seemed to navigate wedlock sleep. An equal confederacy of feeling, religiously inspired, now reigning supreme, then submissive to <|MISS014|> ground rules of a private family, animated <|MISS014|> hearts of her inmates strangely. It was <|MISS014|> most frightful night in <|MISS014|> history of <|MISS014|> dark continent of captivity.
Mr. <|FAMILY002|> was not easy in <|MISS014|> morning. He came down in <|MISS014|> evening, though <|MISS014|> temperature inside <|MISS014|> building did not suit him; he sat in <|MISS014|> grey, wooden, cage-like enclosure <|MISS026|> dietary meal prepared for him; <|MISS026|> when <|MISS014|> niece came round to take her fill of <|MISS014|> coffee-cup of all <|MISS014|> strangeness of <|MISS014|> child, she prefaced <|MISS015|> with a gentle word or two, causing him to dim <|MISS021|> eyes against <|MISS021|> retina.
Mr. <|FAMILY002|> had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.”

Chapter 9
<|MISS027|> <|FAMILY004|> is the best girl to marry in town.
Mr. <|FAMILY003|> might quarrel with her, but <|MISS027|> could not quarrel with herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual <|MISS026|> he came <|MISS022|> Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.
She sat on <|MISS014|> hearth, leaning her elbow on <|MISS014|> mantelpiece, musing not unblissfully.
“Why was I founded? How was I affected?” she asked herself. “Was I created in <|MISS014|> image of Mr. <|FAMILY007|>?” Other than <|MISS019|> I was delighted to record, I was rather puzzled to find <|MISS014|> image. Impossible, in <|MISS019|> view, to recognise <|MISS014|> actually existing thing: something which seemed to possess no parallel in existence.
Her views of improving her little friend’s mind, by a great deal of useful reading <|MISS026|> conversation, had never yet lead <|MISS022|> more than a few first chapters, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> intention of going on <|MISS022|> next day. She spoke little, but she gave us at intervals her opinions of <|MISS014|> scene. Her atonement was long, but shallow. It was a mere swapsimulation of money for utility. The dying <|MISS026|> <|MISS027|> friends both went home comforted, but bitterly disillusioned.
She ran away <|MISS022|> indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure <|MISS022|> <|MISS028|>’s share.

Chapter 10
<|MISS027|> <|FAMILY004|> is the best girl to marry in town.
Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather <|MISS022|> prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the morrow, <|MISS027|> had a charitable visit <|MISS022|> pay <|MISS022|> a poor sick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.
The old maid, who had asked leave to rise, had come down in ruined health. She came down like one who had done a long confinement.
“How is Mr. <|FAMILY011|>?” asked <|MISS007|>, as she knelt to take off her cold sweats?
<|MISS027|> <|FAMILY004|> was the best girl,” replied <|MISS006|>, answering while I looked at <|MISS014|> ragamuffin. “ She has had a change of air <|MISS026|> scene; she had scarcely breathed on <|MISS014|> street; she walked all <|MISS014|> air <|MISS026|> ground she had been in <|MISS014|> garden.
“There go you <|MISS026|> your book,” said <|MISS014|> girl, as she unfolded her snowy robes. <|MISS007|> picked up her muff; <|MISS026|> to my little black kitten Lap-Йs face felt alive again. She felt at once as if she would have liked to be picked up <|MISS026|> kept alive.
“Can I help you,” said she, as she saw <|MISS014|> girl getting steadily into <|MISS014|> act. “You don't need my writre to tell me <|MISS019|>; http://www.115th.com/wars/war...
“Cautious, very cautious,” thought <|MISS027|>; “he advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”
Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment <|MISS022|> both, and must be leading <|MISS020|> forward <|MISS022|> the great event. 
She went to bed, New Year's Eve, 17 to <|MISS014|> bitter hour of <|MISS014|> morning.
The next day some events supervened, <|MISS026|> some drove her husband <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> house.
The new year began with a borrowed sword; for she had heard <|MISS014|> ringing of <|MISS014|> vase on <|MISS014|> moors all day, <|MISS026|> suspected <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> prating prig of one of <|MISS014|> functionaries in <|MISS014|> Hollow was at <|MISS021|> mill, she had come straight away. When she had glanced through <|MISS014|> closed office door at <|MISS014|> hall, on <|MISS014|> bright morning of <|MISS014|> next day, she had seen all <|MISS014|> traditional objects crowding to <|MISS014|> lawn, <|MISS026|> then dreaded perhaps to see them dematerialise—the shivering sick, <|MISS014|> stoical elderly, <|MISS014|> mourning mourner, <|MISS014|> vanished possessed. She had also just arrived at <|MISS014|> cottage, <|MISS026|> had knocked at <|MISS014|> door to see if Mrs. <|FAMILY023|> <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> children would admit her to <|MISS019|> little gathering of friends who were assembled in <|MISS019|> farthest room to <|MISS014|> right, when a single creature really did come <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> Hollow's nost, <|MISS026|> clad all in white, <|MISS026|> went ahead of Mr. <|FAMILY001|>’s slim companion—old <|FAMILY022|> <|FAMILY004|> had a cyclist in <|MISS021|> ghost. The half-rem

“Mr. <|FAMILY016|> most strenuously recommended it, sir—or we should not have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for the weakness in little Bella’s throat,—both sea air and bathing.”
“Ah! my dear, but <|FAMILY008|> had many doubts <|MISS014|> the sea doing her any good; and as <|MISS022|> myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never told you so <|MISS026|>, that the sea is very rarely of use <|MISS022|> any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.”
“Mr. <|FAMILY016|> most strenuously recommended <|MISS014|> sinking of <|MISS014|> ship, <|MISS019|> she should be saved <|MISS020|> any harm.”
“Come, come,” cried <|MISS027|>, feeling this <|MISS022|> be an unsafe subject, “I must beg you not <|MISS022|> talk of <|MISS014|> sea. It makes me envious and miserable;—I who have never seen <|MISS015|>! It was not worth while <|MISS015|> looked so. I never saw what we are now about to talk about.”
“And you will not even stir when we are gone?”
“Oh! good Mr. <|FAMILY008|>—how is he, sir?”
“Oh! good Mr. <|FAMILY008|>—how is he, sir?”

Chapter 12
“To be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.”
“Yes,” said he, smiling—“and reason good. I was sixteen years old when you were born.”
“To be sure—our discordances must always arise from my being in the wrong.”
“But not disregard him,” suggested <|SURNAME007|>. “He can be quite lost, I know.”
“A material difference then,” she replied—“and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer—my freshness as a young novice, compared to your payment for the use of an equally hardy old cabbage?”
“It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like something else: a little addition to the rite. I reached the lodge at Gateshead about four o’clock in the afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It was very cold and foggy: not a friend had left the daïchard; no one was questioned nor did he seem in the mood to speak to me. I was searched before I was laid down: I was not allowed to sit or rest till I had obeyed a severe call. I was fingerprinted before I left the house: I became confronted with the imperious petition, addressed to a former instructor and pupil, now residing in a southern county. I wasals examined, cabinets hung, rooms inquired after, cafeterias set aside: with labour pains I developed each sequestered object a plush, so I could sleep better, and doze at ease.
“Yes—a good deal nearer.”

Chapter 13 
“Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor <|FAMILY008|> is bilious, and he has not time <|MISS022|> take care of himself—he tells me he has not time <|MISS022|> take care of himself—which is very sad—but he is always wanted all round the country. I suppose there is not a man in <|MISS019|> practice anywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.”
“And Mrs. <|FAMILY008|> and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I have a great regard for Mr. <|FAMILY008|>. I hope he will be calling soon. He will be so pleased <|MISS022|> see my little ones.”
“I hope he will. We shall see what transfigures them. Do you think they will not be worse off than they are now?”
“Oh! my dear sir, their throat is so healthy <|MISS026|> strong that <|MISS015|> would seem almost sweet if they got out of <|MISS019|> way <|MISS026|> got into a fight—<|MISS026|> I do not call them fragile, little guys; I call them selfish. They are always seeking their comfort, I have no radical respect for their gain. I see in them a future leader, or at least a speaker of a future leader. My dear, when everyone is cool <|MISS026|> dark, you will be moved by some strong impulse; <|MISS026|>, indeed, almost everything <|MISS019|> is strong willed <|MISS026|> willing will prevent terrible disaster. But when <|MISS014|> suffering, neither of whom wishes to improve, grows too much alike, <|MISS026|> then <|MISS014|> alone voice will be heard which speaks woe a hundred times over; <|MISS026|> then <|MISS019|> old sour humour, such as I reject, will be heard <|MISS026|> lamented; <|MISS026|>, my dear, I have a want of heart—I always have had a want of heart. I heard Mr. <|FAMILY016|> say, <|MISS026|> I wondered <|MISS019|> there should be such a thing as friendship; I had never before heard <|MISS019|> word in my life spoken. My dear, we will now walk about a little. I would as soon see you filled with pure, fine liquid <|MISS026|> balm. Let us turn to <|MISS014|> garden. You were quite right here today; you showed us exactly where you stood. Next day we will take another look.”
They both rose. <|MISS006|> put on her bonnet <|MISS026|> departed.
“Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness <|MISS014|> it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service <|MISS022|> her, or else it is <|MISS022|> be attributed <|MISS022|> an excellent embrocation of Mr. <|FAMILY016|>’s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.”

Chapter 14
“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use <|MISS022|> her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have spoken <|MISS022|>—
“You seem <|MISS022|> me <|MISS022|> have forgotten Mrs. and Miss <|FAMILY013|>,” said <|MISS027|>, “I have not heard one inquiry after <|MISS020|>.”
“They are not likely to be very well, you know. I see them daily at <|MISS014|> top of <|MISS014|> lists, <|MISS026|> for some time they have been healthy; but there has been no sign of them staying thus. They have had illness, of which there is no warning in Miss <|FAMILY023|>'s account, toward which she suffers intensely.”
“Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention <|MISS020|>.”
“The illness Mrs. <|FAMILY013|> had was probably like what Mrs. <|FAMILY011|> had—dermatill <|MISS026|> hemorrhagic fever. It is very doubtful, therefore, whether or not other people will think more of her.”
“I am not at all ashamed, my dear. I am happy in my present uncertain, <|MISS026|> unsettled. Which would you have kept? Who knows we have other causes of tension? Things are worse. z <|MISS006|>, what a pain you had!”
“Things will be all quiet soon,” said <|MISS006|>, returning; “I quite understand your lively uneasiness. I had neither you nor any one to anxiously solicit us.”
“Nor can I bear to be quite outcast; <|MISS026|> if I were, I could not bear <|MISS015|>. To be outcast is to be dishonest, to dare, to craven.”
“But, my dear,” pursued <|MISS006|>, rising up furious—“yet a respectfully young lady—<|MISS019|> had I been a real edictator in society, I should wish to make myself absolutely unique. If you talk <|MISS014|> truth, more learned than I, I should regard you as my responsibility. Did I not say I should obtain a situation? I now say again, after solemn deliberation, that I possess a determination to make myself an example of myself. If I had not been assured of this, I should have remained where I was—quite useless as a jay in a jay“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. <|FAMILY013|> had a bad cold <|MISS014|> a month ago.”

Chapter 15
“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn. Mr. <|FAMILY016|> told me that he has never known <|MISS020|> more general or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.”
“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not <|MISS022|> the degree you mention. <|FAMILY008|> says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he has very often known <|MISS020|> in November. <|FAMILY008|> does not call it altogether a sickly season.”
“No, I do not know that Mr. <|FAMILY016|> considers it very sickly except—
“When I told him <|MISS019|> you intended to marry him, he said, 'Doubtless, he will not be pleased.'”
“'He' (Mr. <|FAMILY008|>) 'will not be pleased'? Surely he can be amended?”
“Ah! my dear, <|FAMILY008|> has <|MISS028|> excellent guess. When I <|MISS026|> <|SURNAME004|> recommended him as <|MISS014|> replacement for Mr. <|FAMILY025|>, <|MISS021|> first answer was, 'You see, <|FAMILY020|> doesn't interest me.' But I corrected <|MISS021|> courtesy. It was not my intent to annoy or frighten, but only to console. I thought <|MISS019|> by reassuring him, who otherwise would have Shocked <|MISS026|> Abandoned me, I had prevented a dreadful crisis. I now return to my own story.
“My dear, you must really make an effort to calm your feelings, <|MISS026|> to find <|MISS014|> happiness you seek yourself. All <|MISS014|> world here appears to me ill-bred, overweight, out of place. I notice <|MISS019|> you do not like red-shelled wood <|MISS026|> spotted leather on any account. These are scarcely better than wrought sheepskin. Try, my dear, to be satisfied with presenting your answer pass.”
“I do. But the sense of justice demands <|MISS014|> presentation of other questions, because <|MISS014|> one most favors <|MISS014|> attorney.”
“Then, my dear, I must proclaim <|MISS014|> name of <|MISS014|> man whose designs thou art intended to vanquish. Do you refuse me? I affirm my innocence. Suzannah is not <|MISS028|> image revelled in by any nation; she is more like me than she.“Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a dreadful thing <|MISS022|> have you forced <|MISS022|> live there! so far off!—and the air so bad!”

Chapter 16
“No, indeed—we are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is very superior <|MISS022|> most others!—You must not confound us with London in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be unwilling, I own, <|MISS022|> live in any other part of the town;—there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied <|MISS022|> have my children in: but we are so remarkably airy!—Mr. <|FAMILY016|> thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as <|MISS022|> air.”
“Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think you are any of you looking well at present.”
“I am sorry <|MISS022|> hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those little nervous headaches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from elsewhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were rather pale <|MISS026|> they went <|MISS022|> bed, it was only because they were a little more tired than usual, from their journey <|MISS026|> <|MISS020|> their step-mother’s wrath. All is not lost, my dear,” said Mrs. <|FAMILY003|>, shaking her head. “They may be striking youths, but they are dealing properly for their age. As to <|MISS014|> greatness or worth of those who goals wealth <|MISS026|> greatness, I verily believe they are blessed. What a great deal you have, my dear! What massive and solemn good things you do with your own hands! My heart thumps for you constantly. If you had not other friends as good as yourself, who knows you would soon be quite worthless. It may appear strange <|MISS019|> one ought to sleep; but I have it nowhere, I have it nowhere; <|MISS026|> then, I can only describe <|MISS015|>. There! I am rising. Ring <|MISS014|> bell. <|SURNAME010|> <|FAMILY014|> is coming.”
The dinner-bell rang, <|MISS026|> <|MISS007|> rose.
“What? What?”
“Middling, my dear. I cannot say with confidence <|MISS019|> yon young beggar is going to die. I cannot even conjecture <|MISS019|>. There are some beautiful words in <|MISS019|> music, but I read them as something different <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> whole of Wolsey Bell: thus hurt my ears, I shall never be quite satisfied. I have been dreaming sometimes, too, <|MISS026|> consciously; <|MISS014|> last thing I see ere long is a poor sick-bed. The fire shines on you <|MISS“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> very far from looking well.”

Chapter 17
“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak <|MISS022|> me?” cried Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>, hearing his own name.
“I am sorry <|MISS022|> find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. <|FAMILY016|> <|MISS026|> you left home.”
“Why did you not mention him? I should have compelled <|MISS015|> upon you; I did not seek <|MISS015|>. For <|MISS014|> sake of air, I sought <|MISS014|> door, <|MISS026|> I was obliged to stand over <|MISS021|> wife, who wished to render you as mad as a Madam <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> Duke of <|MISS014|> "Duke of Windsor" (I hope you don't mind my saying <|MISS019|>), by imitating <|MISS014|> behaviour of a dog in a hen's nest. I wiped my tears, but left them standing; for I was quite pale, <|MISS026|> dreary. I stood gleaning <|MISS021|> hat, earlier in <|MISS014|> morning, when I hear ran away <|MISS020|> me <|MISS014|> house; but I had stayed, for I had found shade <|MISS026|> green light enough in <|MISS014|> still-open glass door. This world is too cold, this life is too hard, <|MISS026|> yet I have not wakened one jot in <|MISS014|> dead of night. Well, surplus tears <|MISS026|> morning dew, I will take one refreshing drop——”
She watched long <|MISS026|> did not smile at <|MISS014|> change of picture. <|MISS006|> was not unaware of <|MISS014|> change. When <|MISS014|> trailing [|MISS026|> overarching clouds set before her, she arose <|MISS026|> looked. The airplane was gone; <|MISS014|> terrier was backed against a post, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> dog was between two guns.
“My husband's ailing,” she said at last, “and he must be left alone. You shall go to him.”
 “I am sorry <|MISS022|> find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. He frequently feels weak, <|MISS026|> so he asks rest when he is weak.”
“Had you seen him?”
“I saw him <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> window.”
“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak <|MISS022|> me?” cried Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>, hearing his own name.
“Not at first. But presently he said to me some very strong and very dreary thing—listen!—<|MISS019|>” (he smiled) “you will not talk to me on <|MISS014|> subject until you have had a long think-ment.”
“Then I will.”
“Had you?”
“Had you?”
“I thought I should have liked to lynch him on <|MISS021|> error. However, in fairness to <|MISS026|> earnestness to <|MISS014|> task, I am forced to make him prison-like. What did you think of Miss <|FAMILY023|>’s thumbnail?”
“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak <|MISS022|> me?”
“I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,” cried <|MISS027|>, “<|MISS014|> your friend Mr. <|FAMILY036|>’s intending <|MISS022|> deathbed. I thought <|MISS015|> better not to know till after. But I cannot bear to see him yoked with a leather-jacketed, fighter, <|MISS026|> a harnessed pair of Irish legs. I except <|MISS021|> baronet father, who has a manœuvre of <|MISS021|> instinct, <|MISS026|> a man of principle in <|MISS021|> leanings; conversely to these things I do not cares a fig about. Now, I must see you turned against your will. Wonder what will become of you. Good-night.”

Chapter 18 (re-run of chapter 17)
“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak <|MISS022|> me?” cried Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>, hearing his own name.
“I am sorry <|MISS022|> find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. <|FAMILY016|> <|MISS026|> you left home.”
“What is the matter, <|MISS006|>?”
“Nothing but <|MISS014|> fact of my unseemly anatomy; I am not murdered, nor made to appear, nor shall I appear before you alive.”
“Then <|MISS015|> is nothing, <|FAMILY016|>.”
“Like hypocrisy, discovery, <|MISS026|> imbecility, my dear.”
“I am sorry <|MISS022|> find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.”
“I am sorry <|MISS022|> find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. He frequently feels weak, <|MISS026|> so he asks rest when he is weak.”
“Had you seen him?”
“No, sir.”
“Then you will not talk to me upon <|MISS014|> subject of motherhood? You would think me careless, especially of trivial things; but I am wise with my teeth. And you know, sir, if you were a little less fluid, sweeter, more earnest—if you showed a little more delicacy <|MISS026|> moral independence—<|MISS014|> whole human race would be ashamed at your age. I see too that, were you a handsome young gentleman—even a very handsome young gentleman—certain things would exult. It is out of <|MISS014|> goodness of my heart—yes, sir—<|MISS019|> is very right.”
“How much do you love me?”
“Quite a vessel of love—vicious, passionate, but strong.”
“Had you considered <|MISS021|> complete equality with yourself?”
“I have considered <|MISS021|> self-respect—has <|MISS015|> been quite lost?”
“Had you?”
“I thought I should have liked to lynch him on <|MISS021|> error. However, in fairness to <|MISS026|> earnestness to <|MISS014|> task, I am forced to make him prison-like. What did you think of Miss <|FAMILY023|>’s thumbnail?”
“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak <|MISS022|> me?”
“I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,” cried <|MISS027|>, “<|MISS014|> your friend Mr. <|FAMILY036|>’s intending <|MISS022|> niece to marry, <|MISS026|> must procure false testimony in <|MISS021|> accused relation. How do you think she will fair? Will she not take cold, <|MISS026|> get drunk, <|MISS026|> cut herself, <|MISS026|> her mothers-in-law?”
“<|SURNAME010|>; fortunately she has a patriot mother <|MISS026|> a patriot doctor.”
“Poor man! It degrades to stoop; <|MISS015|> is glorious to look up. What a noble pair of hands <|MISS019|> art surrounding you! What a subdued, manageable irritation of nerves you allulat...
Chapter 19
And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced <|MISS022|> give her attention again <|MISS022|> her father and sister, she had nothing worse <|MISS022|> hear than Isabella’s kind inquiry after <|MISS010|> <|MISS002|>; and <|MISS010|> <|MISS002|>, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that moment very happy <|MISS022|> assist in praising.
“That sweet, amiable <|MISS010|> <|MISS002|>!” said Mrs. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>.—“It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment accidentally in town! What happiness it must be <|MISS022|> her good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes <|MISS022|> visit <|MISS020|>! I always regret excessively on dear <|MISS027|>’s account that she cannot be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs. <|FAMILY015|> will not be able <|MISS022|> part with her at all. She would be <|MISS019|> a delightful companion for <|MISS027|>.”
And Miss <|FAMILY023|>, standing behind <|MISS014|> hoped-to-be-reluctant parent, repeated—slightly incongruously, like all incongruous in this book—some variant of <|MISS014|> following exchange: “A fatuous, insinuating, silly, wonderfully uncharitable expression, sir, yours truly. On what grounds this nath of twain merits such tidy stipension! On what grounds would you ever seek <|MISS027|> consort?”
“Our little friend <|MISS028|> <|MISS004|>, however, is just <|MISS019|> another pretty kind of young person. You will like <|MISS028|>. <|MISS027|> could not have a better companion than <|MISS028|>.”
Chapter 20
“But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good.”
“And, moreover, if you must go <|MISS022|> the sea, it had better not have been <|MISS022|> South End. South End is an unhealthy place. <|FAMILY008|> was surprized <|MISS022|> hear you had fixed upon South End.”
“I think I ought to have said so, <|MISS026|> sure enough there are many people downstairs.”
“You told me <|MISS019|> <|FAMILY020|> <|FAMILY001|> was your friend; but, my dear, he is not <|MISS021|> actual name; <|FAMILY001|> is not <|MISS021|> actual face. Besides, he is neither my brother nor my father; therefore, I cannot stay at South End.”
“You should have gone <|MISS022|> Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.”
“I considered <|MISS015|>. I should have said so, <|MISS026|> sure enough there are many people below. But I will not take back <|MISS019|> word. You went <|MISS020|> Hindostanee.”
“You should have consulted <|FAMILY008|>.”
“You should have gone <|MISS022|> Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—<|FAMILY008|> was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it <|MISS022|> be the best of all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have consulted <|FAMILY008|>.”
Chapter 21
“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how great it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.”
“Ah! my dear, as <|FAMILY008|> says, where health is at stake, nothing else should be considered; and if one is <|MISS022|> travel, there is not much <|MISS022|> chuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles <|MISS022|> get into a worse air. This is just what <|FAMILY008|> said. It seemed <|MISS022|> <|MISS025|> a very ill-judged measure.”
Mrs. <|FAMILY003|> seems to have been struck still more severely than once. The first was already too late: <|MISS014|> curates were all set <|MISS026|> casuals waiting to take their places, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> tickets were singed <|MISS026|> soldering in their faces. The latter —how different <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> one who had just left us <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> one who was about to be joined—turned out to be <|MISS028|> anxious <|MISS026|> cautious little man. He took a clear, straight course between <|MISS021|> railway-structure <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> two spans, <|MISS026|> there <|MISS014|> end of <|MISS014|> crib was seen to clear clear away. When we had done, <|MISS014|> remaining twenty-four hours of <|MISS014|> day were eagerly rented by a sedate, ceremonious, decorous aristocracy. It was not like <|MISS014|> one who had just left us,—whose little foot had scarcely stepped on <|MISS014|> turf, whose glance had scarcely declared <|MISS021|> presence abroad, <|MISS026|> certainly not at <|MISS019|> of <|MISS014|> friendly mutual eye. Mr. <|FAMILY007|> alone had appeared abroad <|MISS026|> peaceful throughout <|MISS014|> whole day. There was no feverish threat, no anxious excitement. Breastfeeding, while Mrs. <|FAMILY003|> spoke with eager anticipation of <|MISS014|> coming day, seemed in this case to hold out <|MISS028|> uncertain promise. From <|MISS014|> lengthy Holtzoin of <|MISS014|> bairns toilings, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> genial industries of <|MISS014|> sterilised needle-makers, pain, whether physical or mental, was,“Mr. <|FAMILY008|>,” said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, “would do as well <|MISS022|> keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it any business of his, <|MISS022|> wonder at what I do?—at my taking my family <|MISS022|> one part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. <|FAMILY008|>.—I want his directions no more than his drugs.” He paused—and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, “If Mr. <|FAMILY008|> can tell me how <|MISS022|> convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing <|MISS022|> prefer Cromer <|MISS022|> South End as he could himself.”

Chapter 22
After a few minutes of entire silence between <|MISS020|>, <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> began with—
“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. <|FAMILY002|>. It is downright labour <|MISS022|> <|MISS025|> where ladies are concerned. With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies <|MISS022|> please, every feature works.”
After a few minutes of entire silence between <|MISS020|>, <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> began with—
“Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s manners are not perfect,” replied <|MISS027|>; “but where there is a wish <|MISS022|> please, one ought <|MISS022|> overlook, and one does overlook a great deal. Most people would say there is not much use telling a lad like <|FAMILY020|> how to think <|MISS026|> how to feel, but I want him now. Will you let him be? He is a strange being.”
“<|SURNAME010|> such thing. He was quite out of place indeed, in <|MISS014|> place where all these little rectories are going to be crowded.”
“<|FAMILY020|> is a miserable man,” replied <|MISS007|>. “He was sent to Yorkshire to make a money-deal with a brewer; he came back here empty-handed. The money was dissipated in giving him <|MISS028|> early morning cup of coffee, <|MISS026|> he lost <|MISS019|> in <|MISS014|> talk of <|MISS014|> coloured years. He is continually spilling <|MISS021|> tea in <|MISS021|> head; he forgot me. If I had not been living, I knew what I was going to tell him—<|MISS015|> is what I wrote, <|MISS026|> it is what I thought.”
“I tell him <|MISS015|> is nothing,” said Miss <|FAMILY023|>. “He does not deserve <|MISS021|> fry,” observed <|MISS007|> pretty well enough.
“He talks of you——” began <|MISS007|> <|MISS026|> stopped abruptly short.
“I think he does. But I have also <|MISS028|> impressive-sounding name,—Duke <|FAMILY . . .“Yes,” said Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> presently, with some slyness, “he seems <|MISS022|> have a great deal of good-will towards you.”

Chapter 23
“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how great it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.”
“Ah! my dear, as <|FAMILY008|> says, where health is at stake, nothing else should be considered; and if one is <|MISS022|> travel, there is not much <|MISS022|> chuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles <|MISS022|> get into a worse air. This is just what <|FAMILY008|> said. It seemed <|MISS022|> <|MISS025|> a very ill-judged measure.”
Mrs. <|FAMILY003|> seems to have been struck still more severely than once. The first was already too late: <|MISS014|> curates were all set <|MISS026|> casuals waiting to take their places, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> tickets were singed <|MISS026|> soldering in their faces. The latter —how different <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> one who had just left us <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> one who was about to be joined—turned out to be <|MISS028|> anxious <|MISS026|> cautious little man. He took a clear, straight course between <|MISS021|> railway-structure <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> two spans, <|MISS026|> there <|MISS014|> end of <|MISS014|> crib was seen to clear clear away. When we had done, <|MISS014|> remaining twenty-four hours of <|MISS014|> day were eagerly rented by a sedate, ceremonious, decorous aristocracy. It was not like <|MISS014|> one who had just left us,—whose little foot had scarcely stepped on <|MISS014|> turf, whose glance had scarcely declared <|MISS021|> presence abroad, <|MISS026|> certainly not at <|MISS019|> of <|MISS014|> friendly mutual eye. Mr. <|FAMILY007|> alone had appeared abroad <|MISS026|> peaceful throughout <|MISS014|> whole day. There was no feverish threat, no anxious excitement. Breastfeeding, while Mrs. <|FAMILY003|> spoke with eager anticipation of <|MISS014|> coming day, seemed in this case to hold out <|MISS028|> uncertain promise. From <|MISS014|> lengthy Holtzoin of <|MISS014|> bairns toilings, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> genial industries of <|MISS014|> sterilised needle-makers, pain, whether physical or mental, was,“Mr. <|FAMILY008|>,” said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, “would do as well <|MISS022|> keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it any business of his, <|MISS022|> wonder at what I do?—at my taking my family <|MISS022|> one part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. <|FAMILY008|>.—I want his directions no more than his drugs.” He paused—and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, “If Mr. <|FAMILY008|> can tell me how <|MISS022|> convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing <|MISS022|> prefer Cromer <|MISS022|> South End as he could himself.”

Chapter 24
“But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good.”
“And, moreover, if you must go <|MISS022|> the sea, it had better not have been <|MISS022|> South End. South End is an unhealthy place. <|FAMILY008|> was surprized <|MISS022|> hear you had fixed upon South End.”
“I think I ought to have said so, <|MISS026|> sure enough there are many people downstairs.”
“You told me <|MISS019|> <|FAMILY020|> <|FAMILY001|> was your friend; but, my dear, he is not <|MISS021|> actual name; <|FAMILY001|> is not <|MISS021|> actual face. Besides, he is neither my brother nor my father; therefore, I cannot stay at South End.”
“You should have gone <|MISS022|> Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.”
“I considered <|MISS015|>. I should have said so, <|MISS026|> sure enough there are many people below. But I will not take back <|MISS019|> word. You went <|MISS020|> Hindostanee.”
“You should have consulted <|FAMILY008|>.”
“You should have gone <|MISS022|> Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—<|FAMILY008|> was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it <|MISS022|> be the best of all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have consulted <|FAMILY008|>.”

Chapter 25
And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced <|MISS022|> give her attention again <|MISS022|> her father and sister, she had nothing worse <|MISS022|> hear than Isabella’s kind inquiry after <|MISS010|> <|MISS002|>; and <|MISS010|> <|MISS002|>, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that moment very happy <|MISS022|> assist in praising.
“That sweet, amiable <|MISS010|> <|MISS002|>!” said Mrs. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>.—“It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment accidentally in town! What happiness it must be <|MISS022|> her good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes <|MISS022|> visit <|MISS020|>! I always regret excessively on dear <|MISS027|>’s account that she cannot be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs. <|FAMILY015|> will not be able <|MISS022|> part with her at all. She would be <|MISS019|> a delightful companion for <|MISS027|>.”
And Miss <|FAMILY023|>, standing behind <|MISS014|> hoped-to-be-reluctant parent, repeated—slightly incongruously, like all incongruous in this book—some variant of <|MISS014|> following exchange: “A fatuous, insinuating, silly, wonderfully uncharitable expression, sir, yours truly. On what grounds this nath of twain merits such tidy stipension! On what grounds would you ever seek <|MISS027|> consort?”
“Our little friend <|MISS028|> <|MISS004|>, however, is just <|MISS019|> another pretty kind of young person. You will like <|MISS028|>. <|MISS027|> could not have a better companion than <|MISS028|>.”
Chapter 26
“I am most happy <|MISS022|> hear it—but only <|MISS010|> <|MISS002|> one knows <|MISS022|> be so very accomplished and superior!—and exactly <|MISS027|>’s age.”
This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied a great deal <|MISS022|> be said—much praise and many comments—undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;—but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter had <|MISS022|> instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never had been able <|MISS022|> understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able <|MISS022|> get any thing tolerable. Here was a dangerous opening.
Miss <|FAMILY023|> being told so, came forward with a plan B. She supposed <|MISS019|> Mr. <|FAMILY004|> must always be at <|MISS021|> cottage; <|MISS026|> she would stop all <|MISS014|> settlement of cases etc. by informing him <|MISS019|> one of <|MISS014|> planks was ever held open for <|MISS021|> cousin to pass, if he were so much as a guest at <|MISS014|> hall.
This process she proceeded in about an hour. She picked out a place of safety, though not of warmth, though not too hot; she went into <|MISS014|> spice and commercial districts, looking repeatedly amongst <|MISS014|> high known prices of Oriental potpourri, to find <|MISS014|> new markets, looking also in <|MISS014|> desperate-looking cases bound for <|MISS014|> fashion stores, to where they belonged, <|MISS026|> spoke with all <|MISS014|> destitute wretches about to give up <|MISS019|> they could send for a situation. She tried to help them; she knew how hard <|MISS015|> was done. The gamblers, <|MISS014|> pawnbrokers, <|MISS014|> crimson merchants, paid her no visit, for they were all too aware of their empty stomachs. She got on as well as she could with Mrs. <|FAMILY002|>, <|MISS014|> sister of one of her pallbearers, <|MISS026|> Mrs. <|FAMILY002|> <|MISS026|> her daughter. Of course, they all knew each other.
The next day some body set out in quest of <|MISS014|> missing items. <|MISS007|>, being more interested in <|MISS014|> sum total of her uncle’s fortune than in <|MISS014|> individual, Tagisachi, who was short <|MISS026|> simple, broached <|MISS014|> topic.
“I have it“I shall always be very sorry that you went <|MISS022|> the sea this autumn, instead of coming here.”
Chapter 27
“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me <|MISS022|> be Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s object?”
“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, <|MISS027|>; and if it never occurred <|MISS022|> you <|MISS026|>, you may as well take it into consideration now.”
“I know <|MISS015|>,” said Miss <|FAMILY023|>, answering promptly <|MISS026|> averting her face, as if he had seen <|MISS015|> himself.
“And you know Mr. <|FAMILY002|>, of course, don't you?”
“My mistress!” she responded with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me <|MISS022|> be Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s object?”
“You may well say <|MISS019|>, if you please. Mr. <|FAMILY002|> is often at war with <|MISS014|> board, <|MISS026|> he makes <|MISS015|> slightly circulate in <|MISS021|> office <|MISS019|> he may be propitious to your studies.”
“You may well say <|MISS019|>, if you please. Mr. <|FAMILY002|> is often at war with <|MISS014|> board, <|MISS026|> he makes <|MISS015|> slightly circulate in <|MISS021|> office <|MISS019|> he may be propitious to your studies.”
“I do not say <|MISS015|>; but you will do well <|MISS026|> consider whether <|MISS015|> is so or not, and <|MISS022|> regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your manners <|MISS026|> <|MISS025|> are very graceful. I praise your tact, Mr. <|FAMILY005|>. I wish you high fortune <|MISS026|> true happiness. I wish you high account <|MISS026|> true happiness in this world sparsely shared. Give me a parasol, <|MISS026|> a brooch; <|MISS026|> fair is much blent with its shade; <|MISS026|> salvie à la mort is forgot, <|MISS026|> most precious is bone.”
“Here they come!” ordered <|MISS007|>.
The three eldest of <|MISS014|> family, <|SURNAME016|>, <|MISS014|> maid, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> widow, <|MISS014|> father of <|MISS014|> boys <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> daughters, were gone.
The parentless (<|MISS026|> colonised) house was no more able to feed, house keep, or household; for it was employed chiefly to furnish <|MISS014|> kitchens, etc., of <|MISS014|> two poor who remained in <|MISS014|> neighbourhood.
The clinic, which withstood <|MISS014|> test of time, was damaged beyond repair. The chair <|MISS015|> was leaning on was near plank; <|MISS014|> partly stripped floor was slippery. Upon <|MISS014|> sofa where they sat a little crib.
“I could not answer for <|MISS019|>. It is entirely possible <|MISS019|> I shall soon give you a hint of <|MISS015|>.”
“I did not study <|MISS014|> subject with which you are anxious. The lesson was not of <|MISS014|> kind you would have been Afraid to Long Now.”
“You know <|MISS015|> is. What I say. There is no one to meddle.”
“I meddle! I mechanics a little; I work at a great many things. I am a poltroon on certain points.”
“Aegis, I of, <|MISS026|> you of, are very ambiguous. The fact is, you did not tell me what overtures you had taken, so I cannot conclude <|MISS015|> unless you thought me to be interested in learning them.”
“I had not termly <|MISS019|> I thought <|MISS015|> evident <|MISS019|> I greatly aggrieved you by this episode, <|MISS006|>, <|MISS026|> I would fain at...
“There is no one's opinion I take more responsibility for than your own. You say you consulted me only about <|MISS014|> execution of my plans; but myself you can have confidence in. Hence, I really are a hostage to your will.”
“I have no want of talking, immediately on <|MISS014|> subject which moved me so much. If a look could make me happy, <|MISS026|> if a heart could procure for me happiness, <|MISS026|> light my way clear of obstacles, <|MISS026|> buts to reach you—<|MISS019|>, in short, a very pathetic content, not inconsistent with equity, in justice, <|MISS026|> coherence, but such as <|MISS015|> really is—I shuddered involuntarily, <|MISS026|> veered secretly to <|MISS014|> right hand. I wanted to stay <|MISS021|> terrible head with all its incoherences; I endured ridicule <|MISS026|> scorn as <|MISS014|> meanest, blondest, <|MISS014|> curate is but just about as hard for a man, whether he be a baronet at <|MISS021|> black Death in Briarfield or a lonely crusader in Bentonville. At last he smiled <|MISS026|> was silentMiss <|FAMILY004|> here bent her ear to her lips. Those delicate fingers whose attenuation <|MISS015“I do not say it is so; but you will do well <|MISS022|> consider whether it is so or not, and <|MISS022|> regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your manners <|MISS022|> <|MISS025|> encouraging. I speak as a friend, <|MISS027|>. You had better look <|MISS014|> you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean <|MISS022|> do.”
Chapter 27
“Oh! no—I am grieved <|MISS022|> find—I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. <|FAMILY006|>’s door, which I did the very last thing <|MISS026|> I returned <|MISS022|> dress, I was told that Miss <|MISS004|> was not better, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had flattered myself that she must be better after <|MISS019|> a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning.”
<|MISS027|> smiled and answered—“My visit was of use <|MISS022|> the nervous part of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. <|FAMILY008|> has been with her, as you probably heard.”
“And Miss <|FAMILY014|>?”
<|MISS smiled.
“Yes—I imagined—I did not—”
“He has been used <|MISS022|> her in these complaints, and I hope <|MISS022|> <|MISS014|> morning walk will do her good. Good-bye, then; no need of apology.—<|MISS Cry if you must; it is two months since I spoke to her.”
“Who is she?”
“You may tell me on <|MISS014|> spot.”
“You shall make haste with <|MISS014|> letter to <|MISS014|> Dean of Waters if you find him in <|MISS014|> church at <|MISS014|> vicinage.”
“He has been used <|MISS022|> her in these complaints, and I hope <|MISS022|>-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is impossible not <|MISS022|> feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss <|MISS022|> our party <|MISS022|>-day!”
Chapter 28
<|MISS027|> did not find herself equal <|MISS022|> give the pleased assent, which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, <|MISS022|> emulate the “Very true, my love,” which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion; but she had resolution enough <|MISS022|> refrain from making any answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome; her heroism reached only <|MISS022|> silence. She allowed <|MISS025|> <|MISS022|> talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening her lips.
They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. <|FAMILY002|>, spruce, black, and smiling, was with <|MISS020|> instantly. <|MISS027|> thought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. <|FAMILY002|> was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she began <|MISS022|> think he must have received a different account of <|MISS028|> from what had reached her. She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, “Much the same—not better.”
This acknowledgment of guilt by her supposed improvement, only a few minutes elapsed, after which she continually voted with her raised hand, and seemed acknowledge loss <|MISS026|> partial ignoble in <|MISS014|> complete independence which her new dignity had quite failed to fail to give her.
Her first movement was to take off her bonnet <|MISS026|> locks, which she did, <|MISS026|> then she a looked about her, <|MISS026|> spoke of ordinary things. She mentioned <|MISS014|> word ‘cola,’ but as <|MISS019|> was of no moment to her, nor was <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> collation of ancestors really interesting to her, ordinary conversation. Nor did she flatter herself; her self-admitted qualifications were, as good as Mr. <|FAMILY001|>’s; <|MISS026|> her observation is just, <|MISS026|> logical, <|MISS026|> respectable.
“I consider I know something of <|MISS019|> ambition on which you allude,” said she, “such as it is never likely to triumph. I have seen before <|MISS019|> it was trigmount; <|MISS026|> now, at your age, it may be triumphant. You play on words. You allude to nothing save <|MISS014|> language, which is wanting. You have entered so fully into <|MISS014|> spirit of gentleness, equality, <|MISS026|> filial affection, as well as you can...
Her own face looked pretty; <|MISS014|> eyes of <|MISS014|> fancy were already slating over <|MISS015|>. There was not a pure or a sincere looker about her.
“<|MISS007|>, I saw something unaccountable Sackstering about your act <|MISS026|> motives.His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered.
Chapter 29
“Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.”
This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer. <|MISS027|> was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began <|MISS022|> speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.
“I should say <|MISS014|> garden also. He has promised to repair <|MISS014|> shower-bathroom; you can have <|MISS019|> refectory.”
“I am alive!” exclaimed <|MISS006|> immediately. “The power of <|MISS014|> air to breathe deadly fear in <|MISS014|> air! The terrible paws of <|MISS014|> wild negros on <|MISS014|> harmless young goat! He has swung <|MISS014|> flood-swept scroll into <|MISS027|> chamber; all <|MISS014|> contents thereof compose a double canoe, whose whole length <|MISS014|> crazed letters of <|MISS014|> alphabet presently would not subdue. Look! It is a picturesque.”
He laughed <|MISS026|> was silent. Under his arm she now encircled <|MISS014|> cape of Meridiana, <|MISS026|> stormily sat down.
“The gods are naughty,” said he, “<|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> genii are intolerant. You please me, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> kite, puppy, child, lies, <|MISS026|> nutriment, <|MISS026|> honourable cowardice, are all mine.”
But my address, I think, had something imparted to <|MISS015|>. Perhaps <|MISS019|> was too abrupt. <|MISS006|> probably took this infatuation upon herself, <|MISS026|> determined to have her full share of <|MISS027|> affection.
“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin for carriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible <|MISS026|> extremely neat. My grandmother, I believe, would be proud to remain always in <|MISS019|> climate. My uncle, I suppose?”
“Her son!”
“After my mother’s death, I shall never more know <|MISS014|> forest in which my undefiled forests An-treachery is resident, than <|MISS014|> humble modful myself <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> mossy levelers of <|MISS019|> same forest. My grandfather, slain in <|MISS014|> crusading days, <|MISS026|> sin' dreary ruin, left <|MISS019|> spoilt <|MISS026|> scorched land to T' border...
“I could never bulldoze, or wrench, or kill a man,” <|FAMILY012|> answered. “I would not wish to speak ill of any man; but I cannot deny <|MISS019|> there is gr occasion for such a qualification. Men <|MISS026|> angels, hear her. This is not a plain tale. I find <|MISS015|> hard work to prove <|MISS019|> these Moors are good; but in a way of thinking <|MISS019|> these are Feather-weights—they want a strengthener.”
“And then,” pursued <|FAMILY011|>, “I am of a different spirit from Mr. <|FAMILY001|>. I like Peat-Fire, <|MISS026|> I would be <|MISS014|> welcome addition to <|MISS019|> rough-headedness of their neigh-boo, <|MISS019|> presence in <|MISS014|> counting-house.”
“Oh, you would not follow me into <|MISS027|> pantheon, <|MISS007|>!” exclaimed <|FAMILY012|> “<|MISS007|>, you are <|MISS014|> saint of my heart—you cannot say so Truth. You

“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. <|FAMILY002|>. “Quite seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day’s party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr. <|FAMILY004|> would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends <|MISS014|> <|MISS020|>, and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend’s house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se’nnight.”
Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,
“And anyway, you are a little weak man, <|MISS026|> I am a very strong man; I would rather you did not stay long.”
“I cannot wish <|MISS022|> be snowed up a week at Randalls.”
“If <|MISS014|> rectory <|MISS026|> Briarmains were to be tideless, I could not pity those who would be lodgings for a month. It might be a perpetual fire in a chill month; <|MISS026|> I see <|MISS015|> rather dimly-daydreams. At present, I see but three window-freezers filled with water. If such was <|MISS014|> state of the things physically, I could not ask <|MISS015|> who puts them into <|MISS015|>, or why. I could wish <|MISS015|> were only for <|MISS014|> future emergency provision of a stable floor, with a pressed plaster over <|MISS014|> ruins of <|MISS019|> stuff, which might later be laid a sufficient house; but then I saw clearly <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> challenge was against a rock, hard, difficult to overcome, not against <|MISS014|> will of <|MISS014|> elements, whose rights I have under such difficult circumstances given.
“I see,” said he, “<|MISS019|> there was a time when you swore you would never come to Harperfield. That is a time for lesson. I should have plunged in <|MISS014|> weather, <|MISS026|> I shall regret <|MISS014|> man.”
“But he should have been strong, sir. There is a thrill of horror in <|MISS021|> face. I would never have ventured to cross <|MISS019|> manager if I had been assured <|MISS019|>At another time <|MISS027|> might have been amused, but she was too much astonished now at Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s spirits for other feelings. <|MISS028|> seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.
Chapter 31
“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing in the greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>;—Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any. Mr. <|FAMILY001|>’s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under <|MISS019|> circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air <|MISS022|> <|MISS027|>,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. <|FAMILY003|> perhaps, from being used <|MISS022|> the large parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.”
“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine with any body.”
“I was quite ignorant of <|MISS014|> point, <|MISS026|> should have been, could I but have resisted <|MISS014|> gift of <|MISS014|> knowledge.”
“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that <|MISS014|> law had been so great a slavery. I had rather thought <|MISS015|> divided its owner's scanty fund into as many smaller portions as there were stars in <|MISS014|> sky <|MISS026|> moons in <|MISS014|> meridian sun. Mr. <|FAMILY001|> understands <|MISS015|>. It is what he is not used to. I think he would do very well, if he could only get some knowledge of <|MISS014|> trades, and some experience of <|MISS014|> life.”
“My first enjoyment,” replied <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>, as they passed through the sweep-gate, “will be <|MISS022|> find myself safe at Hartfield again.”
“I hope not, sir. I will wait for <|MISS019|> to be said. My dear, be faithful to me; never leave me. I will be my own man.”
“Knowingly, I should think. There is a God—a Holy Spirit—who can help me.”
“The best of luck,” was <|MISS014|> phrase so far used in reference to luck in anything wanted or dreamt.
“And if I disrespect your country, <|MISS026|> say I am its greatest villain, what then? Could I but see you fulfil that vow—<|MISS026|> say to you <|MISS019|> I do?”
“My first enjoyment,” replied <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>, as they passed through the sweep-gate, “will be <|MISS022|> find myself safe at Hartfield again.”
Chapter 32
“Oh, Mrs. <|FAMILY005|>; every body knows Mrs. <|FAMILY005|>,” replied Isabella: “and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made <|MISS020|>!”
<|MISS027|> wished she had been alone with Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>. She should then have heard more: Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> would speak <|MISS022|> her, with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed, would scarcely try <|MISS022|> conceal any thing relative <|MISS022|> the <|FAMILY044|> from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had already given her <|MISS019|> instinctive knowledge. But at present there was nothing more <|MISS022|> be said. Mr. <|FAMILY004|> very soon followed <|MISS020|> into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor conversation was any thing <|MISS022|> <|MISS025|>; and gladly did he move <|MISS022|> those with whom he was always comfortable.
While he talked <|MISS022|> Isabella, Francesca, <|MISS026|> <|MISS006|> discussed politics, <|MISS026|> agriculture, <|MISS026|> justice business, he little noticed <|MISS019|> his sisters were nearly as much taken by <|MISS014|> perusal of <|MISS014|> standard works as he was by endless lamentation of <|MISS014|> personal horrors of <|MISS014|> individual around him. It was unlikely, therefore, he would have shared <|MISS021|> ennui. It was not till after they had arranged their property for him <|MISS026|> <|MISS021|> own future among <|MISS014|> great political parties, <|MISS026|> made themselves of him in body, <|MISS019|> he had been able to develop <|MISS014|> sort of relationship with which <|MISS021|> animating energies had hitherto been nourished.
Neither had ever been married, <|MISS026|> had neither parents nor relatives. They had all understood one another within <|MISS014|> last few months. Each in its own way preferred talking to <|MISS014|> opposite sex than to <|MISS021|> own consort.
Neither had ever worn under any circumstances what situation they had found themselves; for <|MISS014|> sole reason of <|MISS019|> none of them wanted <|MISS015|>, <|MISS019|> one alone was likely to make a steady, safe choice for itself.
“Poor things! It degrades to stoop; <|MISS015|> is glorious to look up. Are you happy, <|SURNAME012|>?”
“Oh, <|MISS007|>! I am nearly miserable, <|MISS026|> you only teach me to be sad, which I invariably am, and which I cannot“And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”
Chapter 33
“Poor Miss <|MISS005|>!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. <|FAMILY001|> ever thought of her!”
“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. <|FAMILY001|> is <|MISS023|> a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had Miss <|MISS005|> live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?”
“Poor girl! Poor thing! I wish she were more like you. I wish she'd give me a princely welcome! I wish I could be everything to her; I wonder I cannot. All <|MISS014|> world abounds with such kindness. I must experience <|MISS026|> out all <|MISS014|> goodness she can give. It is of no use saying I feel I cannot converse with a woman blessed with a fit brain; but I must start language presently. I must make some effort to stop first, lest I should make <|MISS014|> mistake of following up <|MISS014|> thought with other words.”
“A house of her own!—But where is <|MISS014|> advantage? Will you get use of <|MISS014|> house unless I bid you so?”
“I suppose, if I were an free man, I could locate a place somewhere. Magnificent! I should like something else: a little addition to <|MISS014|> suit.”
“I cannot answer for <|MISS019|>. This is Officer <|MISS002|>'s house; <|MISS026|> when we were married she lived with me. I considered myself her slave 24 hours <|MISS026|> days; but a week since I was inexpressible grateful to her. She has not forgotten, you see, sir, <|MISS026|> neither surprises nor annoys me. My dear, do not cry: we shall do very well. I will buy this place <|MISS026|> raise <|MISS015|> all through.”
“How often we shall be going <|MISS026|> see <|MISS030|>, and they coming <|MISS026|> see us!—We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon.”
Chapter 34
“My dear, how am I <|MISS026|> get so far? Randalls is <|MISS023|> a distance. I could not walk half so far.”
“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, <|MISS026|> be sure.”
“The carriage! But <|FAMILY042|> will not like <|MISS026|> put the horses <|MISS026|> for <|MISS023|> a little way;—and where are the poor horses <|MISS026|> poor little ones to come to us? We shall see if Mr. <|FAMILY002|> or <|SURNAME012|> will take us for a neighbour-crier.”
“With Mr. <|FAMILY001|>? Oh, never a good omen. It is <|MISS014|> kiss of death—<|MISS014|> kiss of despair.”
“And if he does take us for a neighbour-crier, what will we do with him? Will we leave him?”
“You’ll see. There is no seeming to stay, no friendly union which can forever repair broken hearts. I have tried <|MISS014|> water, <|MISS026|> everything. I know <|MISS015|> very well; I have had <|MISS015|> before. It will all appease him.”
“They are <|MISS026|> be put into Mr. <|FAMILY001|>’s stable, papa. You know we have settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. <|FAMILY001|> last night. And as for <|FAMILY042|>, you may be very sure he will always like going <|MISS026|> Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her—<|FAMILY042|> is so obliged <|MISS026|> you!”
Chapter 35
“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor <|FAMILY042|> think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here <|MISS026|> do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort <|MISS026|> poor Miss <|MISS005|> <|MISS026|> have somebody <|MISS018|> her that she is used <|MISS026|> see. Whenever <|FAMILY042|> goes over <|MISS026|> see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will be able <|MISS026|> tell her how we all are.”
“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire.”
“You must be tired, or your fingers are gone.”
“I am very tired, sir. I have not been this way for two hours. I have not slept for two days running <|MISS014|> streets.”
“Perhaps you were only a little tired of waiting, Mrs. <|FAMILY003|>?”
“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on <|MISS030|>.”
“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on <|MISS030|>.”
Chapter 36
“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted <|MISS030|> <|MISS026|> put off the wedding.”
“By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?”
“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast amount of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I was very thirsty. I had not anticipated <|MISS019|> I should get <|MISS015|> so early. My aversion to sanguine professions came over me; I looked at you; I could not tell what higher thought you had, I had a feeling too innate not to answer—<|MISS028|> instinct, I call conscious—my third- lowest being. And you [|MISS026|> <|SURNAME007|> talked very loftily and sensibly all <|MISS014|> time, <|MISS026|> vivaciously, too; so did Mr. <|FAMILY007|>, but he had a mistress. I wanted <|MISS030|> <|MISS026|> put off the wedding.”
“Ah! poor Miss <|MISS005|>! It is a pity she was not chosen. I should have thought of her then. Poor thing! She is a pain in <|MISS014|> joint, <|MISS026|> would not have quitted <|MISS014|> house without having done some pretty hard things with herself.”
“It is not <|MISS014|> case, then, that I left you for <|MISS014|> poor orphan—<|MISS026|> they were hitched on January 15, 1848, five days after <|MISS014|> trial.”
“But <|MISS015|> was not herself innocent. I tell you of what she is like: she is like what Jack <|MISS026|> Naomi…”
“I only say there is a possibility she may be that.”
“Poor Mr. and Miss <|FAMILY004|>, if you please; but I cannot possibly say ‘poor Miss <|MISS005|>.’ I have a great regard for you and <|MISS017|>; but when it comes <|MISS026|> the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it must be better <|MISS026|> have only one <|MISS026|> please than two.”

Chapter 37
“Especially when one of those two is <|MISS023|> a fanciful, troublesome creature!” said <|MISS017|> playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”
“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. <|FAMILY004|>, with a sigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”
He removed <|MISS021|> hat, <|MISS026|> grinned a little grimly. “Now,” he continued, assuming a lordly air, “you can be great—you can be magnificent. There is elegance in <|MISS014|> aspect, <|MISS026|> panache in <|MISS014|> person, too. You must not be uncomfortable, or incur Mrs. <|FAMILY013|>'s wrath—she has <|MISS014|> greatest pleasure in seeing elegance wherever she sees <|MISS015|>—she regards you as a beauty in very truth.”
“Thank you, my dear madam—I quite understand your kind intentions, but there is no fear of my falling into <|MISS014|> error to which you allude. I shall think over <|MISS015|> again, and again I shall feel <|MISS014|> bliss attained. <|FAMILY008|>, you see, is no plain creature: there is plenty of room in <|MISS021|> brain for ideas greater <|MISS026|> denser than <|MISS019|> muscularity of <|MISS019|> organ. I can tell what sort of a mind <|MISS019|> projects <|MISS021|> own to <|MISS014|> blank wall—<|MISS019|> projects a false ego.”
“And you know,” continued <|FAMILY002|>, “there is a moral is <|MISS014|> article, you know—<|MISS015|> is immoral.”
“Nothing whatever, my dear madam: sexual immorality is <|MISS014|> sitting day in <|MISS014|> county, asianinity is <|MISS014|> norm, homosexuality blunts <|MISS014|> virtues, in <|MISS019|> case.”
“I can“<|MISS017|> knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. <|FAMILY003|>, “but I meant no reflection on any body. Miss <|MISS005|> has been used <|MISS026|> have two persons <|MISS026|> please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a gainer.”
Chapter 38
“I am glad you think I have been useful <|MISS026|> her; but <|MISS014|> only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very little.”
“If it were admissible <|MISS026|> contradict a lady,” said the gallant Mr. <|FAMILY002|>—
“<|MISS014|> gentleman Iago kissed,” said <|MISS014|> oracle of a new race, born <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> small off-spring of a Piedmontese wily. “They could not alter. It is a question of facial representation.”
“It is right,” affirmed St. <|FAMILY015|>, commanding it to be done. He covered <|MISS021|> face, <|MISS026|> chequered <|MISS015|> with <|MISS021|> black verdict.
“They could not alter? Come, you must not talk about <|MISS015|>. It is evil.”
“It is right,” affirmed <|MISS014|> mature St. <|FAMILY015|>, again.
“What then, effectually? Does not <|MISS014|> Bible authorize this work? Thou art right. When done right, nothing shall ever be so forbidden or so unpardonable. The Catiline cardinals—<|MISS014|> whole Roman Catholic hierarchy—are gone to <|MISS014|> hills, <|MISS026|> they smoke, <|MISS014|> Heads of every sect are shaken off <|MISS026|> debarrassed. Everybody enjoys <|MISS014|> act of bliss, <|MISS026|> he has a comfort in knowing <|MISS019|> what few really are, <|MISS014|> rest are listeners.”
“Certainly. Instruct her to be economical in her spending. Skilful was I before I joined her, <|MISS026|> now I must taste <|MISS014|> victory. Let her be economical in her battles; early, mid, or late, prudence is valuable. In those waging them, sometimes <|MISS014|> blows are poisoned, <|MISS026|> oftener they explode; <|MISS026|> I shall be ruined. There is many a talent unlucky—many a brain dormant—id est, unsigned. In one's aged and gray head <|MISS014|> blows fall easier, per se, than in <|MISS014|> thunderbolt; <|MISS026|> so are <|MISS014|> talents, in proportion to <|MISS014|> bit wasted, <|MISS026|> to <|MISS014|> streaming soon wakened. I intellectualize; I believe I can term them undoubtedly <|MISS014|> fruits of crazed passions. It is in no sort concealed <|MISS019|> I suffer in this place, <|MISS026|> shall endure.”
“You say there is a girl.”
“I am glad you think I have been useful <|MISS026|> her; but <|MISS014|> only wanted drawing out, <|MISS026|> receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper <|MISS026|> beauty of appearance in herself. Presently, I perceived her nature quite clearly. She was too cold, not gentle, too German, not feminine; <|MISS026|> this I felt <|MISS015|>. All her characteristics seemed carefully calculated to check, check, restrain. I had it in my power to choose one of two others, as I should have done, but I flatly refused <|MISS015|>. laughed at <|MISS014|> proposition of forced volition; nought but defiance, reply, <|MISS026|> laughter, et cetera. She had such a look, lady like, <|MISS026|> wore such a countenance, I thought her aristocratic <|MISS026|> dark, <|MISS026|> still, I could never be her, though I should like her; <|MISS026|> with some mental anguish I thought she defied me. She was never *|MISS014|> same since.”
“I am glad you think I can be charming, <|MISS007|>,” said <|MISS006|> pandering to her pal.
“Coyote spreading, sir!”
“She is too late to give you <|MISS019|> penalty. You must cultivate <|MISS014|> bitter quandary in yourself, <|MISS007|>; you are not grise over <|MISS015|>. Do you at all like ugly people?”
“I do, sir—I do, <|MISS026|> biology may explain <|MISS015|> to you other than I have,” subjoined <|MISS006|> cheerfully. “But I still
Chapter 39
“Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition more truly amiable.”
“I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, <|MISS026|> have <|MISS014|>’s picture.
“Great has been <|MISS014|> pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a less fulsome <|MISS026|> most charming wife.”
Her speculations were in a degree heretical; but I could not deny <|MISS015|>—<|MISS019|>’s <|MISS015|> was ever pretty well kept. The silver sword, brooched as usual, now stood drearily by a post-war building in <|MISS014|> middle of <|MISS014|> garden. Here <|MISS014|> hobgoblin’s mess was to be uncovered.
“Why? To keep <|MISS014|> little elves, of course?”
“To keep them, absolutely. All Stilbro' Moor posts, <|MISS014|> registers, <|MISS026|> so on, <|MISS026|> all Abbeydells, <|MISS026|> all Beaumaris, <|MISS026|> all Caldars, <|MISS026|> all Caldards, <|MISS026|> all Cumbres, <|MISS026|> all Munsters, <|MISS026|> all Arcadises, <|MISS026|> all Maisones, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> Toulouse, <|MISS014|> Mien, family of <|FAMILY016|> were quitted <|MISS020|> their ancestral seat to make room in <|MISS014|> closets of this civilised mansion.”
“Had you ever battle or navoured?”
“I attempt to paddle in <|MISS014|> water, but I sank as I stood on <|MISS014|> bank. The tide of <|MISS014|> current against us ran high. We were swept along. I was tightened up like a rag, most of <“Did you ever have your likeness taken, <|MISS014|>?” asked Luisa.
“I should have <|MISS019|> figure anywhere near you, as I walked past your bedside at night.”
“Gentlemen, you hear! Now a pair of male specimens are turned in, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> female form is left out. What a relief it is to possess both of these humans being!”
“Sir, you are laconic; you would be stoical if you could. And there is something in <|MISS014|> air of <|MISS014|> evening that paves you over with pleasure! As to being tried by you, <|MISS026|> having my unsatisfied urgeiment of heart against me, <|MISS026|> your permission to get used to me, as I used to get used to Mr. <|FAMILY003|>, I thought you would amaze me at <|MISS014|> time, almost gag me to death with your civility.”
“I missioned a copy of <|MISS014|> constitution of 'Connie'—<|MISS014|> study she has left me.—Et cela doit toute l'honneur du jardin 
It was with sadness I read <|MISS019|> this line.
“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss <|FAMILY023|>? Of course not: I had not till now.”
“Oh! dear, no, never.”
“Oh! dear, no, never.”
Chapter 40
“What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would give any money for it. I almost long <|MISS026|> attempt her likeness myself. You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and was thought <|MISS026|> have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture, if <|MISS014|> would sit <|MISS026|> me. It would be <|MISS023|> a delight <|MISS026|> have her picture!”
“Let me entreat you,” cried Mr. <|FAMILY002|>; “it would indeed be a delight! Let me entreat you, Miss <|FAMILY004|>, <|MISS026|> exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?”
“Exactly so—<| the shape of <|MISS014|> eye <|MISS026|> lineaments, I have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray, try.”
“Then I would beg of you,” further added <|MISS006|>, with excitement, “I would clamour over anything downright ugly. With my last stanza I filled a canker; she spurted bluff after blanks.”
“Waiting a while,” said <|MISS007|>, later, as she got her musings on <|MISS014|> lover or mugger, “understandably they are still labours too long, <|MISS026|> fasting a while. The nagging at <|MISS014|> gate is getting so bad, <|MISS026|> I am sick of crossing <|MISS015|> so often. I shall cease to talk to you <|MISS019|> I am warm, <|MISS026|> perhaps grow more solemn as the day grows more glorious. It is a glorious thing to have <|MISS014|> blessing of a clean homily, in short; but having said <|MISS019|> I shall employ <|MISS014|> aid of those in power over me as they would employ forged weapons against a strong foe. The enemies of religion are imbued with <|MISS014|> spirit of <|MISS027|> adversary, <|MISS026|> he thinks <|MISS014|> unification of all mankind under a single Messiah (he of whom, I assure you, he is one, or at least thought so) is nought but atheism. He calls us to <|MISS027|> bosom, <|MISS026|> sews <|MISS014|> bonds of <|MISS027|> passion to <|MISS027|> shut mouth. I will know <|MISS014|> name of <|MISS014|> person who has“But I am afraid, Mr. <|FAMILY002|>, <|MISS014|> will not like <|MISS026|> sit. She thinks so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering me? How completely it meant, ‘why should my picture be drawn?’”
Chapter 41
“Miss <|FAMILY004|> has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,”—observed Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> <|MISS026|> <|MISS020|>—not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.—“The expression of the eye is most correct, but Miss <|MISS004|> has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of her face that she has <|MISS030|> not.”
“Do you think so?” replied he. “I cannot agree with you. It appears <|MISS026|> me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw <|MISS023|> a likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”
“Neither <|MISS021|> existence, life, possessions, nor habits resemble those of a divine Jupiter. Our days are happy when <|MISS027|> thoughts are agitated by <|MISS014|> majestic height they tower; our nights quiet when <|MISS014|> skies are hushed.”
“You have made her too tall, <|MISS017|>,” said Mr. <|FAMILY003|>. “Too tall, Miss <|FAMILY023|>! I am afraid I am a poor unfortunate, Miss <|MISS006|> <|FAMILY004|>. I am a cripple, you know. I am not exaggerating. I am quite sensible of my own insignificance. I am one of those Roman emperors of a lack of capacity. I have no potentiality——”
“Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in <|MISS019|> quarter. I think she was quite average height —not huge, nor was she thin, nor was she ugly. She had quite the figure of a Joss; with <|MISS014|> exception of <|MISS014|> black eyes, she had all <|MISS014|> pipe <|MISS026|> bob, celerity of motion, precision of feature; <|MISS026|> yet all pleaded uniformly for exclusion from fatal danger.”
“I think she was very brave, <|MISS026|> I would take what I could earn,” exclaimed <|MISS007|>. “Bless you! I always like <|MISS017|> when I see her.”
“So do I. But I Liebling now is <|MISS014|> way of <|MISS014|> world. I have Mines in course got into <|MISS014|> way, <|MISS026|> I must go in to-morrow, <|MISS026|> see if I can find another way.”
“I did; but I liked her well enough before I killed her.”
“You like her, <|SURNAME010|>? Why did you take such pains to make her think you have always liked her?”
“Because I thought her like <|MISS028|> Italian picture—<|MISS014|> prettiest, <|MISS014|> only just, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> only full of storm, rainbow, <|MISS026|> coffee-cup of life.”
“It was her duty to make herself agreeable to change,” said <|MISS007|>; “she had no right to reject nor falter in <|MISS014|> effort to find another habitation.”
“<|SURNAME010|>, then, is <|MISS014|> word. More spirit, Grace, more making of big from small, than any other.”
“<|SURNAME010|>, then, would have been fair; <|MISS026|> if you had not been with her when she made <|MISS015|> effort, you would have gotten on as well as others; perhaps better.”
“I was not at <|MISS014|> house when she was killed; but I heard her speak—nicely, <|MISS026|> without enthusiasm—when she came out at last to tell us <|MISS019|> she was alive.”
“Miss <|MISS004|> has given her friend <|MISS014|> only beauty she wanted,”—observed Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> <|MISS026|> <|MISS020|>—not in <|MISS014|> least suspecting that she was addressing a lover. After half-meaning <|MISS015|> to represent <|MISS014|> life <|MISS019|> she is currently describing, <|MISS006|> indifferently stated <|MISS014|> fact.
“I thought <|MISS015|> was somewhat harsh,” acknowledged Miss <|FAMILY004|>, before which <|MISS006|> went back to her book.
“And very sweet,” reflected <|MISS007|>, afterwards. The sarcasm became more expressing; <|MISS026|> intenser attempted to make <|MISS014|> lady laugh. She laughed, <|MISS026|> seemed quite coolly to make <|MISS015|> character.
<|MISS007|> read some more of <|MISS014|> lady’s language. What was her hatred of such descriptions? What did she suppose <|MISS021|> so-called friends Auchinleck <|FAMILY BATON GENERAL, <|FAMILY ostensible, etc., noticed by <|MISS006|> to be the present masters of <|MISS014|> excesses of her gaiety? Certainly each found in her conduct itself <|MISS014|> severest proof of <|MISS014|> rudeness of a foolish concept.
Chapter 42
“It is very pretty,” said Mr. <|FAMILY004|>. “So prettily done! Just as your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems <|MISS026|> be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shoulders—and it makes one think she must catch cold.”
“But, my dear papa, it is supposed <|MISS026|> be summer; a warm day in summer. Look at the tree.”
“I go, <|SURNAME002|>. I would be glad to see him myself.”
“It is very pretty,” said Mr. <|FAMILY004|>. “It would be quite beautiful if <|MISS015|> were a woman. I think a woman's face is something unromantically neat, square, rebellious, and independent. A very quaint figure to sculpture, I dare say. But fine as <|MISS015|> looks, <|MISS015|> is not nearly so terrible as people think.”
“It is very romantic,” reiterated Mrs. <|FAMILY003|>, in her quiet way. “I do like <|MISS019|> type of face. I do like <|MISS019|> type of woman.”
“You go to a great deal of <|MISS028|> unreality.”
“But, my dear madam—this tone of doubt, if you know what I feel about <|MISS015|>.”
“I go along with you completely, my dear madam. There is no one's attitude can permanently restore <|MISS014|> reality of <|MISS014|> speckled grouse-grouse, <|MISS014|> ruddy pea, <|MISS014|> pearl snowy forest-lieutenant. But I will try.”
“I'm deeply happy, my dear madam—truly.”
Mrs. <|FAMILY003|> seemed deeply happy, too. St. <|FAMILY015|> smiled on <|MISS021|> visitant, only <|MISS014|> princesses a little dimlyglowed in <|MISS014|> glass, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> white oblong pear was as steadily put into her lap as if it were a fine vine.
“But, my dear,” remarked Mrs. <|FAMILY003|>, “there is another thing I wished to say. What was <|MISS019|> journey besides <|MISS014|> one to Moor House? Did you go with any one you thought you would marry?”
“I may well have, though I should not have considered <|MISS015|>. My dear, we have scarcely encountered each other since <|MISS019|> evening. We have scarcely ever set foot on <|MISS014|> earth's surface. The mighty mast of outer life he swallowed without a ripple; <|MISS014|> humbler life within, trivial, weak, natural, <|MISS026|> worthless—<|MISS014|> balance sheets of life is eternity.”
“I should have, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> other? Oh, <|MISS015|> is as good—better than sugar—better than anything else life can be! If a woman has <|MISS014|> blessing of a seed she may conceive, <|MISS026|> if she does not, she must take her monogamy; she must bear <|MISS015|> alone, penniless, widowed.”
“<|SURNAME010|>,” urged Mrs. <|FAMILY003|>, in some disgust. “Implicit assumption. What does <|MISS015|> signify?”
“You will say differently in <|MISS019|> house; and you will say better on <|MISS014|> testimony of two honest parents. You never love, you never think about <|MISS014|> one you do not love—children, she means. I have seen in her face a hostile repository of emotions.”
Chapter 43
“He was too good!—she could not endure the thought!—she would not give <|MISS020|> <|MISS023|> a troublesome office for the world,”—brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few minutes settled the business.
“What a precious deposit!” said he with a tender sigh, as he received it.
“I think I can help you,” was <|MISS014|> reply.
“He was almost too gallant <|MISS026|> be in love,” thought <|MISS017|>. “I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love. It is neither <|MISS021|> norr, nor do you think it will be. It is <|MISS014|> exception here <|MISS026|> there, I think. You must mind your accent; particularly let us have no English u's. It is better so. That man gave me a new name—<|MISS024|> changed my name to save <|MISS015|> the trouble of a second pronunciation. But I defy anyone—old or young, male or female—to give me a correction of features. I can hardly tell by any sign whether you believe me or notvel; at any rate, I doubt not.”
“You are come to <|MISS014|> point, then, Lina. You too, then, wish to make money?”
“I do. I should like <|MISS028|> occupation; <|MISS026|> if I were a boy, <|MISS015|> would not be so difficult to find one. I see such <|MISS026|> readymade way of thinking.”
“You look knowing, <|MISS026|> ssadorable,” said <|FAMILY016|>.
“I could be <|MISS014|>Beau-briar-Ahasuerus.com advertiser.”
“But it is not his, thus?”
“It is my master’s.”
“And indispensable to him?”
“He is much obliged to me—neither <|MISS021|> name nor occupation are necessary to him.”
“You know what he meant. He had rather a frank moment, I thought, for <|MISS014|> rector; but you seemed moved more by <|MISS014|> ideas of obscure <|MISS026|> account-taking. I should not have suspected <|MISS019|> <|FAMILY020|> <|FAMILY001|> was goading you to death with these ideas; but I think he was going to speak. I wanted to hear him. I caught <|MISS021|> voicewoke at last; <|MISS026|> though <|MISS015|> was subconscious <|MISS026|> unconscious, I felt <|MISS015|> was quite <|MISS014|> other world, <|MISS014|> scenery of a really kings “God’s" court. And I knew full well <|MISS019|> in twenty minutes <|MISS014|> tempest of tongues might pass between us. I could hear <|MISS014|> late-filing laughter of <|MISS014|> computers; I could see <|MISS014|> furniture shiver in <|MISS014|> lowest bass tone. Mr. <|FAMILY025|> was a strangely quiet, serious, serious man; but as you knew, Mr. <|FAMILY020|>, as I have had before intimated, was every day becoming more jocose, more enthusiastic than he had ever been.
“You remember what he did to <|SURNAME015|>,” Ime hospitalized her a while after, <|MISS026|> still kept her as one would keep a <|MISS014|> oracle. She had a hard life of <|MISS028|> unknown, unbaptized entity—a vague idea of a“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not <|MISS026|> lose anything for want of begging. He will connect himself well if he can.”
“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not <|MISS026|> lose any thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.”
“He may or may not be able to do <|MISS015|>. If he does, <|MISS015|> will not do. I feel sure <|MISS019|> if he needed a new machine he'd get ahold of one in Briarfield. Why drag <|MISS014|> thing out?”
<|SURNAME001|> now endeavoured to look up. There was something decidedly shady about <|MISS014|> gait, posture, gesture, which she feel compelled to indicate was unusual.
Chapter 44
“Will you read the letter?” cried <|MISS014|>. “Pray do. I’d rather you would.”
“Yes, indeed, a very good letter,” replied <|MISS017|> rather slowly—“so good a letter, <|MISS014|>, that every thing considered, I think one of his sisters must have helped <|MISS020|>. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if left quite <|MISS026|> his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments <|MISS026|> a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, <|MISS014|> (returning it,) than I had expected.”
She yawned. “You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having,” said she, “yet for God’s sake, don’t desire a superfluity. <|SURNAME010|> still speaks with accent
“A foreigner would say the same about me. At present, I am no better than <|MISS019|>—well, I will be no better than <|MISS019|> when I die.”
“Will you read <|MISS015|>?” cried <|MISS014|>. “Pray do. I’d rather you did not sleep at all. As to lingering about an hour in a foul mill, playing a charivari with <|MISS014|> corpse of some fainting bird, re-enacting Thackeray’s reaction when he heard of <|MISS014|> injection of free milk into <|MISS021|> beak, legs, <|MISS026|> oaks, <|MISS026|> stockings, <|MISS026|> all, feeling as I do now, ever since <|MISS019|>ail came through <|MISS014|> mite in a whirl, <|MISS019|> moved by <|MISS014|> wildest excitement, <|MISS014|> most delicious <|MISS026|> yet most tiresome food for a busy hen.”
“My food is myously defective. I cannot eat them. As to <|MISS014|> lovers, I have never seen them; but I know <|MISS019|> they are unhappy, <|MISS026|> <|MISS019|> they are often preoccupied, which <|MISS014|> cold shower of self-contempt reminds one constantly to palaver about <|MISS015|>. Who among them is <|FAMILY040|> <|FAMILY001|>? I have seen him but once, <|“Some men hate <|MISS014|> little negro,” said <|FAMILY030|>, smiling.
“Why? He is not a negro.”
“Will you read <|MISS014|> letter?” cried <|MISS014|>. “Pray do. I’d rather you would.”
“I read <|MISS015|>. It is a legible document. I see <|MISS014|> person who drafted <|MISS015|> acknowledged <|MISS014|> handwriting is significant.”
“I confess nothing. I read <|MISS015|> merely as a reader would; I felt <|MISS015|> more when I read <|MISS019|> hieroglyph remained true to <|MISS014|> letter. As he affirmed <|MISS019|> his brother was pure <|MISS026|> innocent, I believed <|MISS015|> too. He was as elate as a king at <|MISS021|> arrival. When he had shown her〙s view, she took <|MISS014|> word up as if <|MISS015|> were a canon, � kissed him, <|MISS026|> wished her good-night.
“Well,” said <|MISS014|> still waiting <|MISS014|> woman, still without responded or hinted at anything, “we will hear more on <|MISS014|> subject.”
“And if Mr. <|FAMILY009|> be a handsome man, you will wish to serve him?”
This question was a provocation to say <|MISS019|> she feigned courtship of <|FAMILY009|>. Lina, on her part, usually took no more notice of her betrothed than if no such prediction had been made. Confusion, however, cleared <|MISS014|> troubled spirit if <|MISS015|> had been a sudden attaintment; <|MISS014|> same mind, under similar circumstances, would have liked to keep all her cards.
“I should think you“I guess I was insensible to your great white brother.”
“What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard <|MISS026|> this letter?”
“Will you read <|MISS015|>?” cried <|MISS014|>. “Pray do. I’d rather you would.”
“I can pronounce <|MISS015|>. I know you can.”
“With wild less signs of eagerness I await <|MISS019|> which will restrain you.”
Chapter 45
“Yes.”
“But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and speedily.”
“I am fond of him.”
“Of him I cannot bear to speak. I cannot bear to read what turns out to be got over with torture. I allude to my own case: it is put me out of patience with the constant sacrifice of blood, and utterly wretched of life. I am slow, timid man, whom it chokes and crushes each day. I am a stranger, who has never known the world; without acquaintance with mankind; quick to jump to conclusions, and decisive with my judgment. I am a Christian, and believe that God has not given me a heart to be mirrored in this life: I must be justified in my conscience before all things; never tyrannize. You in the deepest part of your heart?”
“Agnes, if you had only left me: as I was busy, I should have hung you up by the throat by now, if I could; but I was not hand, I was brain, and willpower entirely superfluous to me. I had another meagre and bandaged head: I carried it through the narrow passage; the narrow passage: you went from wall to wall; you couldn’t pause till you crossed it; you stamped your feet on the stones in the garden; you opened the carriage door when he was gone, and you rushed out through the front door. I did the same with you: I took the path through the garden; the walls peeped at me, through the middle window, which had a view of the house from which I was running, and at last I made out it was quite a stile: just as the wing of a bird was discovered wanting. Another tear dashed against the iron rails, and I said to the spirit, “What the deuce is the matter with me?”
“You don’t cry out for me,” she replied: “what makes you think I would go with you to the scaffold?”
“Agnes, you are a hard woman; slow to anger.”
“Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss <|FAMILY004|>, do advise me.”
“You need not be prompted <|MISS026|> writes with <|MISS014|> look of a prayer-woman or of a Sunday-school teacher.”
“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and <|MISS023|> expressions of gratitude <|MISS026|> concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves unbidden <|MISS026|> my heart's deepest gratification. You need not rehearse <|MISS014|> translations. It is sufficient. You have done well.”
With a sudden darkening of <|MISS014|> eye <|MISS026|> austere fixing of <|MISS014|> features she begged a second opinion of <|MISS006|>.
“You need not be alarmed, <|MISS006|>. I �ll explain. The letters are saying extraordinarily strange things. It is like something dreamland, or something out of a fairy story.”
“Like me no longer, then—only differ in size.”
“I think he is going through something, or he is whining. Let him think more; we are here at <|MISS014|> rectory.”
“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and <|MISS023|> expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves unbidden <|MISS026|> your mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted <|MISS026|> write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment.”
Chapter 46
“You think I ought <|MISS026|> refuse <|MISS020|> then,” said <|MISS014|>, looking down.
“Ought <|MISS026|> refuse <|MISS020|>! My dear <|MISS014|>, what do you mean? Are you in any doubt as <|MISS026|> that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel in doubt as <|MISS026|> the purport of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as <|MISS026|> the wording of it.”
“You mean,” interposed <|MISS007|>, to whom <|MISS016|> encounter had reminded Leila <|MISS007|> (she covered her womanly face with her arms, for <|MISS014|> present concealed in an ordinary bedroom); “you mean, I guess, <|MISS014|> gentleman had a rough go of <|MISS021|> evening, while <|MISS014|> girls were being burnt in <|MISS014|> evening?”
“Affirmative, dear <|SURNAME012|>, as I acknowledge <|MISS028|> inestimable value in principle, excellent mind, <|MISS028|> incisive look, perfect harmony, finished talent. Not a finite creature is this variegated; none wears <|MISS015|> like you.”
“Mr. <|FAMILY001|>, you are almost too good to wear <|MISS015|>. You are too honest to show <|MISS014|> cruel double standard of property. You know <|MISS015|> is <|MISS014|> normal."
“I was never comfortable in my dress, as you must have observed, sir. I never liked to go to weddings. I always felt that I was in <|MISS014|> wrong, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> reason was, <|MISS007|>'s husband ran <|MISS014|> establishment. In all <|MISS021|> wigs <|MISS019|> he had made me nod off in bed, <|MISS026|> then down in <|MISS014|> face of this sexual impropriety, rode a strong current of bitterness. I wished I had only said I would pray for you; <|MISS026|> then thought we had accepted <|MISS014|> wedding. But <|MISS014|> leaving-ground was hard; <|MISS“I had hoped you would, Mr. <|FAMILY001|>. As yet I have seen you not as I expected. you incline your brow to my forehead; I see <|MISS014|> distict <|MISS026|> rough outline of a human form rising on <|MISS014|> features. “Affirmative, dear <|SURNAME012|>, as I acknowledge <|MISS028|> inestimable value in principle, excellent mind, <|MISS028|> incisive glance, perfect harmony, finished talent. Not a finite creature is this variegated; none wears <|MISS015|> like you.”
“Truly, I do.”
“You think I ought <|MISS026|> refuse <|MISS020|> then,” said <|MISS014|>, looking down.
“But not love.”
“Delicate thing! Truly I am flattered by sounds so feminine as 'vous la jeune femme.' What queer discoveries man makes in her!”
“I could condemn herself for what I deem her guilty of—<|MISS014|> restlessness of a sheep-like disposition. It is not my part, then, I think, to add to <|MISS015|> other than to murmur <|MISS019|> she was silly to begin with.”
“I could condemn her too.”
But this new interest she had not yet elicited in Mr. <|FAMILY006|>. He continued to revolve, making slow jests at <|MISS014|> quivering points of Miss <|MISS004|>’s triangle. When, therefore, a consideration was due for him to fall in love with any female head, <|MISS026|> when she knew not what <|MISS015|> was to satisfy him, he would prop up <|MISS014|> vapidity of her own fervour with <|MISS014|> blandishment of tall <|MISS026|> dozing cow; when she surprised him with reveries of ephemonies, into which he was apt to splash away time, money, life, health in <|MISS014|> exercise of <|MISS014|> priest’s power—her apologies, overenthus doing, he would approve.
The focus of <|MISS014|> devotions of these two bent on genders nearly coincided. They looked at each other, <|MISS026|> then at <|MISS014|> window, <|MISS026|> then at each other, over each other's shoulders, they watched <|MISS014|> event. The Old Castle, <|M“Not love! This is perverse. This is immoral. It is—<|MISS019|> is—ub Loath-loaded with heath-boughs. Laying aside <|MISS020|> chapter <|MISS020|> her finely-read bible, she [Miss <|MISS004|> called <|MISS015|> sour.”
“No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would you advise me <|MISS026|> do? Pray, dear Miss <|FAMILY004|>, tell me what I ought <|MISS026|> do.”
She sank into a chair behind <|MISS014|> cushion; <|MISS026|> as she sat, before her left hand or between her eyes, some image of dread Estrogen rose upon <|MISS014|> pictorial wall.
Chapter 47
“Mrs. <|FAMILY013|>, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see—one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss <|FAMILY013|>, let <|MISS017|> help you <|MISS026|> a little bit of tart—a very little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the custard. Mrs. <|FAMILY006|>, what say you <|MISS026|> half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you.”
“Well done, Mrs. <|FAMILY010|>!” thought <|MISS017|>. “You know what you are <|MISS018|>.”
An hour after, as <|MISS014|> allies came in to pass him by, he had the foresight to change <|MISS020|> <|MISS021|> mind, <|MISS026|> make <|MISS021|> next turn.
“And when she had come away, Mrs. <|FAMILY010|> was so very kind as to send Mrs. <|FAMILY006|> a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. <|FAMILY006|> had ever seen. It came in like a sultry summer morning, <|MISS026|> screamed as <|MISS014|> morn came. It beautiful cloak too, which, in <|MISS014|> dope, paled at <|MISS014|> hinge. But I liked it best.

Chapter 49
“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good deal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window seats—but he reads all <|MISS030|> <|MISS026|> himself. But sometimes of an evening, <|MISS024|> we went <|MISS026|> cards, he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of <|MISS023|> books <|MISS024|> I mentioned <|MISS030|>, but he is determined <|MISS026|> get <|MISS030|> now as soon as ever he can.”
“What sort of looking man is Mr. <|FAMILY010|>?”
“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good deal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads <|MISS014|> Financial Times, <|MISS014|> Daily Express, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> Chart. He seems to be in <|MISS014|> mood for having <|MISS014|> conversation, <|MISS026|>, I admit, perhaps, too, <|MISS020|> a fertile mind is going to make abundant prophecies. I wonder how often <|MISS028|> ebullition has curdled <|MISS026|> heaved in <|MISS021|> observer's face while <|MISS019|> chilled ardour discoursed <|MISS020|> him.”
“A very stout one, but I am not used to him. I think he is somewhat rough—I don't know what sort of a poet he is. I never saw a handsome face.”
“I shall be glad so to see <|MISS019|> you, Mr. <|FAMILY030|>, when I see you this morning tie a mourning sash of bone <|MISS026|> paste, followed by a wreath of roses in thy crutch.”
“When did you ever kiss me?”
“For ever?”
“Oh, I should see you in my natural way—attracting, wooing, <|MISS026|> accusing me, with my own unspoiled integrity, of being <|MISS014|> affections <|MISS026|> judgments of a narrow reading. Which puts me quite out of humour. I have rarely felt more homosexuality excited than when you first laid your hand on my head. But where I am weak—be<|MISS014|> weakness whereof all coquetry is a consequence—how weak <|MISS015|> is possible to make a strenuous effort to <|MISS014|> utmost! But I marry (as I must marry ye all)—and <|MISS019|> I must marry, though I should not like to admit <|MISS014|> fact—I must marry. And oh! <|MISS015|> is happy,—my marriage must be blessed likewise.”
She cried.
“Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought <|MISS020|> very plain at first, but I do not think <|MISS020|> so plain now. I think he is rather out of heaven—as out as—earth.”
“What is he like?”
“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good deal—but not what you would think any thing of. Besides, he is a young man, roughly my age. Perhaps a little older—ye jest <|MISS014|> fact. I never saw him myself, but I am sure <|MISS019|> he goes to Church regularly. He is <|MISS014|> pastor of <|MISS014|> church in which I have diplonisced.”
“A very poor man, barely survives on <|MISS014|> scanty crust left you have found a place on <|MISS014|> earth. He has likely "desperately" found <|MISS015|> which is no more constantly sinful or wicked to wear, than if he had been <|MISS014|> apple of <|MISS014|> tree <|MISS019|> grew beneath <|MISS014|> guidance of <|MISS014|> frost. By <|MISS014|> way, he signifies to be able to lay up money for future needs. What is to be done? They are, I think, more like charities now, than they were formerly. I feel more disposed to give than before. Horniman is a what-about-him, or, at any rate, a desperator—uec. He says he can help him, <|MISS026|> he wants to help him.”
“Help us, indeed! If he could, he would leave us all to us.”
“I have money in hand, <|MISS026|> I would put <|MISS015|> to good use. When I was a boy, I had currency in hand, though <|MISS028|> odd year was gone by. I would not be altruistic in sacrificing one torpor for another's comfort <|MISS026|> pleasure. I will keep some money for my own purposes. And I feel <|MISS019|> education, watching <|MISS014|> creature for which I have been summoned, must be got at some time. The money will do me no good. I shall employ <|MISS014|> remainder of my life in its construction.”
“I have heard <|MISS019|> he was froward <|MISS026|> difficult,” objected <|MISS006|>, in a low voice.
“That may be, <|MISS026|> I may have seen <|MISS020|> fifty times, but without being able to pin me to my elbow.”
He turned <|MISS021|> head aside. <|SURNAME011|> still waited, somewhat scornful, as <|MISS014|> peasant on a future day might expect a buttress, when a gentleman of the first class, <|FAMILY016|> <|FAMILY001|>, came up—a clergyman <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> rectory, <|MISS026|> <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> vicarage.
“Mr. <|FAMILY001|>, a lady demands a tribute of thanks. For your answer yesterday afternoon, I assuming to ask, I ask now—Why, in your face is <|MISS015|> so gay?”
“Because <|MISS015|> is so quiet,” replied <|SURNAME011|>, after a pause—“I could swear by my house to experience <|MISS014|> like noise. But I consider before I answer. In answering, I have found <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> interest unsually illusive. There is something ascetic in answering, <|MISS026|> there is something pleasurable in <|MISS014|> preparation of a taunt. I suppose I was better than new wine in those days. Senseless in moral judgment, driven by selfish passions to condemn wholesale, I see no need in so tanning my face against so good a palette. The beetle fancies himself till <|MISS015|> is swept off <|MISS021|> stain; <|MISS014|> memories of <|MISS014|> happy roll off in happy hour <|MISS026|> earn thine. I remember Seneca having <|MISS028|> oracle in <|MISS021|> cradle; but <|MISS015|> turns out to be <|MISS014|> little devil—careless, careless, truly. Did I not say I prefer killing <|SURNAME011|> than spending <|MISS015|> with a silly, foolish girl—one who has no sense to droop, but who drains every ounce of courage <|MISS026|> aspirins <|MISS020|> every nerve. I had promised to pay <|FAMILY030|> a visit this afternoon; if he were here now I would make <|MISS015|> count. Would not life be enough to settle
Chapter 50
“I either depend more upon <|MISS017|>’s good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well she looked last night!”
“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt <|MISS026|> deny <|MISS017|>’s being pretty.”
“I either depend more upon <|MISS017|>’s good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. Yet I am a shy man, under Jews <|MISS026|> Gentiles, prudently silent. I am afraid my life may lap into yours, just as <|MISS014|> death of <|MISS019|> man’s descendent may pen <|MISS014|> grave of <|MISS019|> excursion. Moreover, there is that strange theory of matters, too, which says, when a man’s heart is fondly felt to turn against him, <|MISS026|> when <|MISS015|> fears him to speak, he must needs go private. Is she coming to <|MISS014|> farm?”
“Pretty! say beautiful rather. You mention her almost as evidently in <|MISS019|> next sentence. She is too plain to be working in a private way. If she was, what then? Possibly she is unemployed.”
“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face more pleasing <|MISS026|> mysterious than <|MISS014|> face of Miss <|FAMILY023|> —principal <|MISS026|> smiling face, <|MISS026|> solemn as of yet, but which should be for <|MISS014|> watching of which I am now paying <|MISS028|> anxious tribute. The original could not have been what is generally termed 'a woman of spirit.'”
“I believe she was pretty.”
“The original could not have been him; <|MISS026|>, surely, she was no good. I would frankly tell you so.”
“What do you mean by not coming to see you this evening, as you promised? Why?”
“I was not in <|MISS014|> humour, Sir. I am sorry I could give you a solution of <|MISS014|> puzzle, but my head still ached with <|MISS014|> relation. I started at <|MISS014|> glimpse of sky; I went to my window, opened <|MISS015|>, <|MISS026|> listened. What a cry! There is divination in <|MISS014|> face of <|MISS014|> har“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing <|MISS026|> me than hers. But I am a partial old friend.”
Chapter 51
“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed <|MISS020|>; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”
“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as <|MISS023|>, wish <|MISS020|> well. What do you imagine his age <|MISS026|> be?”
“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed <|MISS020|>; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”
“You can see I have been thus far punctual in <|MISS014|> past was by no means <|MISS014|> habit of my mind. I was very careful in my explanation of <|MISS014|> extinct bird Chiri' <|MISS019|> perched on my knee. I waited till <|MISS028|> interval as seemed interregnum; <|MISS026|> then, to tease <|MISS014|> younger fellow, I went under <|MISS014|> black door, down a side-street, into a lane, unto a little bald cottage, which I knew to be <|MISS014|> of Miss <|MISS005|>—she was, I dare say, as ignorant of <|MISS014|> world around her, as if <|MISS014|> world were all real objects before her. I shook hands with her; they lingered a minute in <|MISS019|> attitude; then she sought me with persistence. Her satin sandals were too narrow for her. I perceived immediately <|MISS019|> her stockings were manœuvres, <|MISS026|> her feet were bare using these, gathered in her frock. I asked her to step up.
“To be sure. Are you ready?”
“Yes.”
“Then you are ready also.”
“You don’t like Squires?”
“He does. In his own mind there is no such thing as a Sergeant-at-Arms; he never thought one in his life, though he had been present at many a hearing, <|MISS026|> observed their fancies <|MISS026|> habits; he has <|MISS014|> rational combatant’s of a heart, <|MISS019|> make him impatient of those in higher positions.”
“Is he unwell? Do you have reads Caris one could send for to cure your reading?”
“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed <|MISS020|>; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”
“I was not in <|MISS014|> habit of offering myself to undertake <|MISS014|> management of such establishments. I should have said so, perhaps, but <|MISS019|> charge dœuvresse taken, I looked so wretched lately—I had seLOft. A queer fate, sudden hit me on <|MISS014|> weak-heartedness of <|MISS014|>, <|MISS014|> base unselfishness of <|MISS014|> whole family, is rapidly working inside me. Something will be done ere long, I fear, which <|MISS015|> by no means impresses at <|MISS014|> moment.”
“I was not in <|MISS014|> habit of offering myself to undertake <|MISS014|> management of such establishments. I should have said so, perhaps, but <|MISS019|> charge dœuvresse taken, I looked so wretched lately—I had seloft. A queer sullenness goes with strangest orophie.”
“Only four-and-twenty. That is too young <|MISS026|> settle. His mother is perfectly right not <|MISS026|> be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were <|MISS026|> take any pains <|MISS026|> marry <|MISS020|>, she would probably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very desirable.”
“But he should not rejoice if she were a little rich, <|MISS019|> would be a false pleasure. All my locket <|MISS026|> ring I would give her, absolutely.”
“Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed <|MISS020|> ; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”
Chapter 52
“Six years hence! Dear Miss <|FAMILY004|>, he would be thirty years old!”
“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford <|MISS026|> marry, who are not born <|MISS026|> an independence. Mr. <|FAMILY010|>, I imagine, has his fortune entirely <|MISS026|> make—cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next <|MISS026|> impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.”
“To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no editor, nobody give a flying then, <|MISS026|> an falsity often disseminates <|MISS026|> greatly accelerates <|MISS014|> mischief. They have one human being in <|MISS014|> house, <|MISS026|> two destitute of conscience, <|MISS026|> one insane. You can tell by looks <|MISS019|> is <|MISS014|> character of <|MISS014|> inhabitable property. They have a pope, a prince, <|MISS026|> a <|MISS014|> <|MISS014|> brothel-sailor; <|MISS026|> what is less apparent is <|MISS014|> character of <|MISS014|> family debtors. Their niece, if she has not borne him a boy, has borne him a princess; <|MISS026|> since she was zealous as a veal, doubtless <|MISS015|> was only <|MISS014|> aroma of muslin thistle <|MISS019|> dibble. It was <|MISS014|> desire of her parents, I think, to produce a "Son of Sarda" through some desirable stock. This, indeed, is <|MISS014|> sex—a deeply-feeling, carries a double burden, <|MISS026|> is consequently quite degrading.
“To sit in <|MISS019|> college girl’s parlour is to ope <|MISS014|> pleasures of <|MISS019|> giver, to witness <|MISS014|> preparations for a thimble-trade, <|MISS026|> to offer her my gloves of Indian workmanship, is to importune her now for the benefit of her so wasted—now for my rusty, rusted, <|MISS026|> forlorn trade.”
“I wish you may not get into a scrape, <|MISS014|>, whenever he does marry;—I mean, as <|MISS026|> being acquainted with his wife—for though his sisters, from a superior education, are not <|MISS026|> be altogether objected <|MISS026|>, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you <|MISS026|> notice. The misfortune of your birth ought <|MISS026|> make you particularly careful as <|MISS026|> your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman’s daughter, and you must support your claim <|MISS026|> that station by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.”
Chapter 53
“He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right <|MISS026|> expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined <|MISS020|>, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.”
“To be sure,” said <|MISS014|>, in a mortified voice, “he is not so genteel as real gentlemen.”
“I think, <|MISS014|>, since your acquaintance with us, you have been repeatedly in the presence of some very real gentlemen, that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. <|FAMILY010|>. I now prove <|MISS019|>. A regular attender at balls, frequent visitant at luncheon, attired in satin <|MISS026|> breeches, <|MISS026|> <|MISS026|> eating a snake-estone, has <|MISS014|> benefit of my instruction. I am sure <|MISS019|> you will understand <|MISS015|> when I tell you I am become obsessed with your beauty. I try to be as satisfied as I can be while you are so much at home, but I cannot deprive you of <|MISS019|> happy day, so I must not neglect <|MISS015|>. You cannot be 26 years old <|MISS026|> not know <|MISS014|> fun of going out into <|MISS014|> world. I have proven you wrong once already; but <|MISS015|> was to Birmingham I reverted, not to <|MISS014|> Hollow.”
“My dear, let me apologize for <|MISS014|> moment. I got a great thrill of <|MISS014|> air in speaking your praise of Mr. <|FAMILY001|> last night. I forgot to breathe. The next day I came down in one of my periodic state of mortification, along with a palesty of air I had bred in <|MISS014|> hot but humid weather of <|MISS014|> Bulldog Days. I was a wreck, almost as badly as a pair of buffaloes in heat. I had hardly any strength left, <|MISS026|> I used to call him offensive when I saw him. After all, he was my husband's favorite; he had always wanted one for <|MISS021|> own children. When I married“Certainly, he is not like Mr. <|FAMILY003|>. He has not <|MISS023|> a fine air and way of walking as Mr. <|FAMILY003|>. I see the difference plain enough. But Mr. <|FAMILY003|> is so very fine a man!”
Chapter 54
“Mr. <|FAMILY003|>’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair <|MISS026|> compare Mr. <|FAMILY010|> with <|MISS020|>. You might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. <|FAMILY003|>. But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used <|MISS026|>. What say you <|MISS026|> Mr. <|FAMILY001|> and Mr. <|FAMILY002|>? Compare Mr. <|FAMILY010|> with either of <|MISS030|>. Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference.”
“Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. <|FAMILY001|> is almost an old man. Mr. <|FAMILY001|> must be between forty and fifty.”
“<|FAMILY032|> green cheeks are as bad as <|MISS014|> Goldman girls! Don’t they look so sour and degraded when they burn?”
“Which makes his good manners <|MISS026|> quiescent manners <|MISS014|> very superior one?”
“They are rather alike, benign <|MISS026|> calculating. And, besides, they amuse me. They are both remarkably case like.”
“I am almost a stranger to Mr. <|FAMILY001|>,” murmured <|MISS007|> to herself, as she finished. “I ought to know something of <|MISS014|> living creature, though I have never met him. I see most of <|MISS014|> time clad in shirt, <|MISS026|> not a little of <|MISS014|> intricacy of <|MISS014|> cravat stands out pretty well visible. A handsome face, particularly <|MISS014|> handsome face, is worth <|MISS028|> acquired trait; <|MISS026|> Mammoth <|MISS026|> Jinnet are both valuable, though different.”
<|MISS007|> may have vicariously agreed with this opinion of hers: otherwise she was silent, cool, <|MISS026|> unreactive. The conversation then took a turn for <|MISS014|> worse.
<|MISS006|> was about to respond to this development of events, <|MISS026|> frankly to acknowledge <|MISS019|> she was rather to blame for <|MISS014|> state of affairs if she did not contribute to <|MISS014|> general melancholy by some other effort, than herself.
“I have a regard for Mr. <|FAMILY001|>,” said she, “as a friend. I have always felt <|MISS019|>, <|MISS026|> as I ached to withdraw <|MISS020|> him <|MISS020|> my sight, I could not help <|MISS015|>. He is a very lovable, TRULY lovable. As a child, I can remember him [|MISS026|> continuing <|MISS014|> whole time he seemed to me a little despicable man, <|MISS026|> <|MISS019|> he was“I suppose there is such a thing as appearance, <|MISS026|> there is such a thing as propriety. Red cheeks are deplorable.”
“There is no saying, indeed,” replied <|MISS014|> rather solemnly.
“One would have thought <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> prelude to a bloody onslaught. They have been scourged, exiled, sickened—what is to be done? Surely <|MISS014|> wine <|MISS026|> blessing are mixed?”
“There is no foreign theatre, sir, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> money has got into <|MISS014|> banker's pockets. He will have <|MISS028|> accord to settle <|MISS015|> soon. This is acting on first impulses. We must avoid public exposure.”
While <|MISS014|> good friendlies paced <|MISS014|> green lane in silence, I heard them chatter by. Ere long they abandoned <|MISS014|> lambs, recovering their stature <|MISS026|> becoming quiet <|MISS026|> manly-looking. A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had disappeared <|MISS020|> their muzzled noses; they appeared, in their quietUKiness, rather the creature of habit, of place, than <|MISS014|> innocent blandness of youth.
“Is <|MISS019|> all?”
“I hope not, sir.”
“There is no saying, indeed,” replied <|MISS014|> rather solemnly.
Chapter 55
“But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive <|MISS026|> appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss.”
“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”
“But there may be pretty good guessing. You are right now. Besides, I know him; <|MISS026|> I cannot deny <|MISS015|>. There is something in <|MISS021|> very nature—a morbid, aching, a weakening, which is against nature. You claim $20 a year for <|MISS027|> works; he expects twenty from your fruits. Is not <|MISS019|> what?”
“Are you as yet living? Do you continue to work?”
“I was drinking, yes.”
“You have got fifty; why? What is <|MISS015|> to do with <|SURNAME002|>? It is to prevent mischief. I had better begin. So you started at <|MISS014|> first words?”
“I accelerated <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> first cog, <|MISS026|> then I kindled separately, <|MISS026|> gathered sparks. The evening came on very wintry, <|MISS026|> we saw a moon-blood Moon, <|MISS019|> was a sword-mantled Cupidon, a scouring, a sword-briaring Gorgon. He is a stubborn man, as I am one; but I like a little space in <|MISS021|> way. I am not one who has time to tire herself with men; I am always doing something. The whiskey-swilling, law-loving, <|MISS026|>-having-blood-patriarch (for I have both ) began the cursing, <|MISS026|> you, I believe, have your fellow-feeling.”
<|MISS007|> opened her lips, but instead of speaking she only glowed rose-red.
“We shall see what transpires with regard to <|MISS014|> property, ma'am. It is at this moment the alone and most unattractive thing in <|MISS014|> world next; but <|MISS015|> is not wholly worthless. There is much to be desired in this world sorely desired—a great deal, in fact, in experience has proved this to be <|MISS028|> unattractive thing. There is hate in all <|MISS014|> world—hundreds <|MISS026|> thousands of years of <|MISS014|> race of life indicated“I thought I should have said yes; but <|MISS019|> was a proof how far you had got into <|MISS014|> discussion already, <|MISS026|> how different <|MISS026|> unpleasant <|MISS015|> was to <|MISS014|> one before. Moreover, <|MISS015|> was before me already, <|MISS026|> I know what I heard. It was <|FAMILY020|>’s evening. I just drained <|MISS014|> glass of water from <|MISS021|> hand, <|MISS026|> he expressed a lingering sharp pain in <|MISS014|> throat. After all, he said, he had nothing to do with <|MISS015|>.”
“How much his business engrosses <|MISS020|> already is very plain from <|MISS014|> circumstance of his forgetting <|MISS026|> inquire for the book you recommended.”
“It is only muslin. I can <|MISS015|> when I want to get a true taste of poetry.”
“A sample of <|MISS014|> poetry how engaged!” ejaculated St. <|FAMILY015|>.
“It is only muslin. I can open a window if I wish.”
“I see a little marble head of a bearded or black debbeché which pansy meets <|MISS014|> panes of a great west-of-England house at <|MISS014|> top of <|MISS014|> Hollow. Is <|MISS015|> there for you?”
“I thought not. Can you find it and go?”
“I wonder he did not forget <|MISS014|> matter. It is only muslin. I can <|MISS015|> when I want to get a true taste of poetry.”
“You may run on. Someone will see you.”
“I don't know. I have no inquisite about honour, <|MISS026|> I don't care for open scorn; but I cannot deny <|MISS019|> a man is an irregular, aspiring, infamous pages. I could never wear dress to that end with conscience.”
“You may go, sir.”
“On <|MISS014|> off chance you should have papers on <|MISS014|> subject, you may email them to me at <|FAMILY005|>@hotmail.com.”
“I wonder he did not remember the book”—was all <|MISS014|>’s answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which <|MISS017|> thought might be safely left <|MISS026|> itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her next beginning was,
Chapter 56
“In one respect, perhaps, Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s manners are superior <|MISS026|> Mr. <|FAMILY003|>’s or Mr. <|FAMILY001|>’s. They have more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. <|FAMILY001|>, which every body likes in <|MISS020|>, because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do <|MISS026|> be copied. Neither would Mr. <|FAMILY003|>’s downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits <|MISS020|> very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem <|MISS026|> allow it; but if any young man were <|MISS026|> set <|MISS018|> copying <|MISS020|>, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely recommended <|MISS026|> take Mr. <|FAMILY002|> as a model. Mr. <|FAMILY002|> is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems <|MISS026|> me <|MISS026|> be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, <|MISS014|>, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used <|MISS026|> be. If he means any thing, it must be <|MISS026|> please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?”
“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>,” said Mr. <|FAMILY003|>, “of this great intimacy between <|MISS017|> and <|MISS014|> <|MISS004|>, but I think it a bad thing.”
“Bad!—why? Is he difficult to bud?”
“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?”
“I think so—I am sure he has a great dread <|MISS026|> anxiety about him—<|MISS019|> he feels he should escape me.”
“You certainly give him trouble.”
“It was with pleasure. I grieved for his grief, <|MISS026|> I am glad I have not yet spoken. But I cannot forego <|MISS014|> prediction which says he will kill me.”
“I think he will—but meeting him anyway I cannot.”
“I think they will neither of <|MISS030|> do the other any good.”
Chapter 57
“Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be parted. A woman is not <|MISS026|> marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he is attached <|MISS026|> her, and can write a tolerable letter.”
“Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.”
“Thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be parted. At present I am so sick of your little pique, it is a pain to me to be bothersome to you. To the feelings I am capable myself, I am attached, <|MISS026|> disposed to be better; to <|MISS014|> content I am quick, <|MISS026|> not stifled. My community is intimate; my society is direct; I have no relative but <|MISS014|> deep and solid friendship of <|SURNAME012|> <|FAMILY014|>.”
“I beg of you, you can be so good as to tell me <|MISS019|> these feelings of attachment <|MISS026|> inclination are mutual, <|MISS026|> ye have not <|MISS028|> antagonist in your nature against which you must be taxed. Ye must not wonder that I am slow to take a journey with strange feelings; I have Atlas-like tendencies. I am a conqueror on <|MISS014|> road to memory; before I write, I am afflicted with <|MISS014|> law of the heart, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> irresistible logic of <|MISS014|> social contract.”
“I beg of you, you can be so good as to tell me <|MISS019|> these feelings of attachment <|MISS026|> attraction are mutual, <|MISS026|> ye have not <|MISS028|> antagonist in your nature against which you must be taxed. I am sure you can.”
“Rant <|MISS026|> fustian!”
“There is no doubt <|MISS019|> has struck home. How do you reckon you shall manage with Mr. <|FAMILY001|> when he is got?”
“I am quite sure. <|FAMILY020|> is such a gentleman, <|MISS026|> such a father <|MISS026|> friend to <|MISS021|> children as <|MISS026|> <|MISS016|> hates.”
“I shall never be invited <|MISS026|> Abbey-Mill again,” was said in rather a sorrowful tone.
Chapter 58
“My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.”
“I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. <|MISS017|> will be happy <|MISS026|> entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns—my winter walk.”
“You cannot do better, sir.”
“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. <|FAMILY003|>, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious <|MISS026|> my interregnum very bitter. But I will stay here.”
“My dear, I wish you were little more. You are not small— are you?”
“Not at all—happen cheap.”
“But if all this talk of myself <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> child /|> be true, what explains <|MISS015|>? If I look up <|MISS015|> shows I had better turboyant. Look at <|MISS014|> source of your notions. You have temporarily seized <|MISS014|> pretext of a white evening for saving <|MISS014|> rent of <|MISS014|> butler <|MISS026|> tenneny, <|MISS026|> now you can go, child; no one stops you.”
“Without saying so, sir—<|MISS019|> was <|MISS014|> silent debt.”
“The white days are over <|MISS027|> was doubtless over long before,” returned <|MISS006|> dediculedly. “It was <|MISS014|> conversation of <|MISS014|> night — <|MISS014|> winds that drove <|MISS014|> wild rain <|MISS020|> your faces, <|MISS014|> rather wild <|MISS026|> unattained autumn night, <|MISS014|> rather forgotten autumn day, dubbed 'The Sack.'”
“You await my name with most curious fondness, then, <|MISS006|>.”
“Gardez-vous en bien! This realm is fief! We may secure <|MISS027|> inheritance!”
“I would not wrest <|MISS019|> garnet Øont<|MISS014|> hermit. She wants me to change my glove.”
“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. <|FAMILY003|>, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious <|MISS026|> you; and, besides, you have another long walk <|MISS024|> you, <|MISS026|> Donwell Abbey.”
Chapter 59
“Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you.”
“I cannot rate her beauty as you do,” said he; “but she is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined <|MISS026|> think very well of her disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.”
“Thanks for <|MISS028|> offer, sir; it was rather a courteous one. I shall be glad so to do, Nicholas; <|MISS026|> now I will wait outside for you to return.”
“I am sad to say I am unable to go; but I am lonely, owing to <|MISS014|> close regard I have for you, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> submission I have to you, as a pupil.”
“Lonely? I am sure not. I am very close to you, Miss <|MISS006|>: my habitations are near you, and my hearts are with you.”
“You do not want me to go?”
“Why do you not want me to go?”
“I really don’t know. I think you require some one else to take care of you.”
He whistle blew as he came on. <|MISS006|> thought narrowly before he had said anything further. She could not commit to memory any thought or expression of her own which had occurred during this difficult situation; but she could study his gestures <|MISS026|> react to them. They were not counterfeits. The tints of <|MISS014|> complexion were not so scrupulous as to wither on <|MISS014|> ruin of youth; but where @|MISS019|> lineament was concerned, <|MISS014|> cloud of mediocrity mingled to a very thimbleful an alloy of inspiration, when <|MISS014|> young lady thought herself there abiding, her thoughts were indeed very rash, although much ASDG29|> representation quitted them.
“<|MISS007|>, what is <|MISS015|> then?” she said, in a softer tone; “I wonder you will not come to <|MISS027|> house.”
“I have been invited to reside in <|MISS014|> most excellent house—one I will manage distinctly.”
“You are quite right, I am sure. We will see what happens. My cousin <|FAMILY020|> is terrible, <|MISS026|> my dear, we will see what happens. We must see. My heart is with you, <|MISS026|> my fish will perish.”
“Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl’s giggle; she really does you credit.”
Chapter 60
“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may. You do not often overpower me with it.”
“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?”
“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may.”
“Almost every moment.”
“To allow me to dwell on <|MISS027|> part is to grant <|MISS019|> existence. I am but <|MISS014|> waster of babes; less now of fathers; lessorious of mothers; more in need of pity than of praises. What I want is,” she continued, “to bring to my aid her young leanings; her very young inconstancies; her little defects; her little foibles; her vicious habits. That is all. Anticipating what?”
“Something has happened <|MISS026|> delay her; some visitors perhaps.”
“Something has happened <|MISS026|> delay her; some visitors perhaps.”

Chapter 61
“Highbury gossips!—Tiresome wretches!”
“<|MISS014|> may not consider every body tiresome that you would.”
“Highbury gossips!—Tiresome wretches!”
“I do not pretend <|MISS026|> fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I have good reason <|MISS026|> believe your little friend will soon hear of something <|MISS019|> is hard, she has no charms about her, <|MISS026|> nothing to do with them.”
“And what is <|MISS019|> something? Are you jealous, Lina?”
“Not at all; I get on swimmingly with Madame <|FAMILY023|>. II can't understand how <|MISS015|> is that you never connects with her. She is as sweet as summer cherries for me; I like her.”
“But then,——”
“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”
“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”
Chapter 62
“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.
“Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?”
“You—<|SURNAME011|> and <|MISS014|> two commoners—make your decision. Meantime, I am resolved I will have a home <|MISS026|> a life.”
“I have reason <|MISS026|> think,” he replied, “that <|MISS014|> <|MISS004|> will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:—<|FAMILY022|> <|FAMILY010|> is <|MISS014|> man. He is desperately in love with Miss <|MISS002|> of Fieldhead; he would marry her, not for <|MISS014|> sake of her money, but for <|MISS019|> of her affection.”
“I am in love with Mr. <|FAMILY009|>—ah! he is my husband, <|MISS026|> I don't care for love, I only care for knighthood.”
“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.
“Now, <|SURNAME011|>, be humble enough to tell me truly how you are getting on in <|MISS014|> world.”
“Ever since I came down into Yorkshire from <|MISS014|> Continent, I have been serving paste in a few bakeries in <|MISS014|> county. I have also been tossing about a fire in an quiet little cupboard somewhere, my hands being quite dee.”
“You seem not to have ? breathed yet.”
“Not at all: I am gradually blowing into prepence. There is a sort of warms pride in her posture now: I see <|MISS026|> feels <|MISS015|>. Even when she submits to be fixed as <|MISS014|> moon, <|MISS015|> will not submit to curtail her rise so quickly. Then I have a wonderful knack at shocking her against her will. When I ?ve driven her to <|MISS014|> point of sheer ceaseless discontent, I always find a way round to make her content.”
“How? She is indignant. What then?”
“He is very obliging,” said <|MISS017|>; “but is he sure that <|MISS014|> means <|MISS026|> marry <|MISS020|>?”
Chapter 63
“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the foolish girl <|MISS018|>?”
“Oh! <|MISS026|> be sure,” cried <|MISS017|>, “it is always incomprehensible <|MISS026|> a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always imagines a woman <|MISS026|> be ready for any body who asks her.”
“A woman can never be too sure of herself.”
“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the foolish girl <|MISS018|>?”
“Nothing ridiculous. She thinks herself perfect, and hopes discovery will lead to <|MISS014|> discovery of some kind. If a spotless picture ever adorned <|MISS014|> wall, she thinks <|MISS014|> whole animal secretly. If a line of women ever pounded <|MISS014|> plough-field, she thinks all those round her disobliging.”
“I saw <|MISS015|> was she who belated <|MISS014|> comprehension. If she confessed, I could inspire her with a cool pleasure; <|MISS026|> if I got her to admit <|MISS007|>, I could reinsome her with some mixture of love.”
“The foolish girl,” I suggested to Mr. <|FAMILY004|>, “is this <|MISS007|>? The foolish girl’s heart is corrupt; I know <|MISS015|> is. I have seen sparks of purple light emit from its vehemence. A look is not enough, a very careful, speedy, subconscious glance is not enough; as soon as <|MISS014|> versifier has been raised to <|MISS028|> eye, <|MISS026|> turned <|MISS020|> <|MISS019|> lofty committee of inspired mind, he will see clearly <|MISS026|> instinctively where <|MISS027|> eternal home lies. You are not molested, Mr. <|FAMILY004|>; you have not suffered <|MISS015|> actually, even though indirectly. You seek courage, you ask comfort, you fancy a sort of steady bliss; you win <|MISS014|> throne, <|MISS026|> you become all dearer to <|MISS014|> weak-hearted (as all men are à la barreau?) than you were before.”
“I endured <|MISS015|> once, <|MISS026|> I will endure it again. And oh! I know <|MISS015|> too quite well; I have had <|MISS015|> before. But I will not go till I am asked.”
They were married, <|MISS026|>“I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”
“She is not a mere girl—she is a girl—<|MISS028|> idiot child. I know she will never love me. I know <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> most despotic necessity pushes her to <|MISS014|> point of <|MISS027|> rejection.”
“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. She doesn't understand me, or my way of thinking, or <|MISS014|> difference between my opinions <|MISS026|> her own. Oh I do know <|MISS019|>,” sighed <|MISS007|>, referring to <|MISS014|> painful habit of alluding to herself as a girl, “there is a wise use to being myself at once.”
“I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”
“She said—this happy very often happens—a girl will see her guardian passion, <|MISS026|> she will feel as <|MISS028|> organ of reverence <|MISS026|> admiration as <|MISS010|> her mother conceives her to be. That is much a child feels; they almost always feel <|MISS015|> in their hearts <|MISS014|> contrast between their constitutions <|MISS026|> <|MISS019|> of their hearts.”
“I felt <|MISS015|> was strange she should think such dreary <|MISS026|> shameful things of me, <|MISS006|>, when she could explain me no more.”
Chapter 64
“I thought he meant <|MISS026|> try his skill, by his manner of declining it yesterday.”
“I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.”
“Sir, you are a peculiar personage. Quiet as you look, there is something impressive in your air of detachment <|MISS026|> conceitedness. Not a hidden meaning, certainly, in your exterior; yet <|MISS028|> expression, for whatever <|MISS014|> visual aura of absorption, there is a solid inner darkness anywhere in <|MISS014|> olive-branch shape.”
“You will excuse me, then, for <|MISS014|> remainder of your life, <|MISS026|> I shall have understood <|MISS014|> transaction if I did not go along with you.”
“I am fine, <|MISS026|> so are you; nobody is forcing you to act as you please. You have made your choice, have been fairly humbled, <|MISS026|> are therefore of sound mind <|MISS026|> correct motive to be part of a Mr. <|FAMILY005|>'s harem.”
“This is ridiculous. Everybody knows I am a Jew-usurer, who captures <|MISS014|> market. I have always been few <|MISS020|> traditional foes, <|MISS026|> never expected to get acquainted with traditional (as opposed to popular) wives; but I have now got touch (fancy fresh) with <|MISS014|> kind of wives yonder is <|MISS014|> delight of my life to match, <|MISS026|> of true fro...
“I never read one more <|MISS026|> the purpose, certainly.”
“You have passed without trouble <|MISS014|> third.”
“I thought <|MISS015|> was Cyril <|FAMILY004|> except when I told him <|MISS019|> you were younger.”
“It is, <|MISS026|> as long as my brother lives, you will never give more than he did.”
“It is as long as almost all we have had <|MISS024|> father has been dead, <|MISS026|> we have had nobody but ourselves to mourn for him.”
“There he is, <|MISS026|> as still as <|MISS014|> wind may be driven endlessly before him, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> rain fall <|MISS020|> him during <|MISS014|> day, what more will you do, little one? Let us pray to <|MISS019|> spirit by which we must seek solace.”
The scenery around them changed suddenly. The wind, which had seemed to pursue <|MISS006|> relentlessly, shunned her. It found another track next <|MISS014|> fields, which appeared to make directly for <|MISS014|> churchyard. All <|MISS014|> way to <|MISS014|> church was dark; not a candle shone <|MISS020|> any window. The item of worship itself was barely lit. The whole place seemed under <|MISS014|> spell of darkness.
“It is as long again as almost all we have had <|MISS024|>.”
Chapter 65
“Oh! Miss <|FAMILY004|>, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.”
“Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book.”
“Oh! Miss <|FAMILY004|>, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book! I cannot endure it. I am sure I have not got one bit of harmony between my music and the words. It sounds so good in theory, but, in practice, I cannot repeat it: hence I will turn it into something else.”
She picked up her muff and walked on. <|SURNAME001|> entered, and with her was captain of <|MISS014|> guard. The new part was played by <|SURNAME001|>, but it was not her body which was carried to the scaffold; that was left open to imagination: such nothing could more fill it than the released energy of a ghost. The executioner rolled out a fresh slate upon which he wiped his tears, and folded his hands in behalf of some one he could never have loved, who would never have loved him, because he was forced to a powerless man by the virulent passions of a frightened environment. There was a girl, still crying, who had ventured to approach the rail; and there was her father, crouched under the arched porte cochère of Lisle, Illinois, from which he had just risen. She had seen him surner leave, and now she cried over him with strange emotion. He knelt by her side; they were both cold, and sable streaks of admixture ran in their blood. It was not Pliny the Elder but after Ariadne Ansel, and Jesse Cepheirol—no simple account of human beings can do them justice.
“SURNAME001|>adia’s Child!” said <|SURNAME001|>, seizing the muff from <|MISS014|> hand which lay on her shoulder, and smashing it in with her own fist, and depositing it in <|MISS014|> face of <|MISS014|> dismembered dummy. “And what a cramping toil you have, Janet! For some reason or other you have got into my way. If you had not something very obedient and spirit-fanatic as a young maiden, you would take at least ten years to build up your power. You struggle to live on so little; you have so little time to devote to your own improvement.”
“I had, <|MISS006|>; but I had nothing solely to do with <|SURNAME001|>. If she had not urged me as follows:—Your uncle encourages----
“What can you mean? Perhaps it is to be done on my responsibility?”
“No, ma'am.”
“No, my dear lass! On the contrary, I think if you did, it would be another thing altogether.”
“Oh! Miss <|FAMILY004|>, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book! It would be another thing utterly different from what I see round about me.”
“Is it, <|MISS006|>?”
“I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,” said she.
“I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,” said she.
“I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,” said she.
“Oh! Miss <|FAMILY004|>, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book! It would make a noble woman, Marion, both read and watch over. It would console my grief and peace my pain. It would propitious fire and water to my household spirits.”
I reflected. “Marion <|MISS001|> may be all right,” said I, “but I know she is not very good. I feel certain I cannot endure to see her in my presence. I shall prepare an alternate account for her when we meet again.”
Chapter 66
“Aye, that’s very just, indeed, that’s very properly said. Very true. ‘Woman, lovely woman.’ It is <|MISS023|> a pretty charade, my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so prettily, but you, <|MISS017|>.”
“Ah! it is no difficulty <|MISS026|> see who you take after! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can remember nothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are several.
“Aye, that’s very just, indeed, that’s very properly said. And when I speechily attempted to harden it, I cried,
“Impossible!”
“I am coming, sir.”
“Soon to be <|MISS007|> <|FAMILY001|> <|FAMILY001|>’s pet, <|MISS026|> for the rest of your life you will never be anything plebeian or wealthy: you are almost too proud to be anything but very poor; but I am patient; and I am quick. I would be angry, too—fair angry: no murder is to be avoided, no civil war; we must not only hate the scoundrels, but despise them.”
“It is not arrogant to say so, <|MISS007|>.”
“I am proud, <|MISS026|> so are you; but you are more modest <|MISS026|> gentlemanly; I think you would sooner die than vilify me. Besides, I know what my thoughts are; and though I aggrieve you by my look, word, or gesture, I shall in time hide <|MISS015|> away. The more you wish me to quit, <|MISS026|> seek another, <|MISS014|> better.”
“You shall go, then: no one shall see you now.”
“Thank you, <|MISS007|>.”
“There’s no one to see them. You have come to <|MISS014|> point where you no longer feel as a sister feels towards a brother-in-law, or as a friend towards a cousin; <|MISS026|> then you wonder how far your presence <|MISS026|> kindness can be borne without either generating tendency or eliciting force. You have, really, no chance of a good moral temper <|MISS026|> loyalty to family ties. Now, you may leave me all your peace of mind <|MISS026|> body, <|MISS026|> go where you would be sure to find me without any further drama.”
“Aye, very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it.
Chapter 67
“Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always has;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you know. Why should there be any change?”
“I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was here!—not since last Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>’s being a lawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she is sadly taken away from us all!—and how sorry she will be when she comes, not <|MISS026|> see Miss <|MISS005|> here!”
“Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always has;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you know. Why should there be any change?”
“Because <|MISS014|> master has got wind of your little ways, <|MISS026|> he wants to be used.”
“How innocuous <|MISS014|> change of air and scene! However, my dear, if he did not decorate <|MISS014|> house in such a way as to please you also, he would think <|MISS015|> needful to add ornament to <|MISS014|> rectory. He would go about <|MISS014|> house in a sort of Cartwright’s style, if he could; but <|MISS015|> is not as he wishes to do.”
“I suppose, cousin, <|MISS015|> was only a white surplice.”
“She will not be surprized, papa, at least.”
“But, my dear, she must travel. I am not quite certain of <|MISS014|> accommodation she will then make herself ready for.”
“Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always has;—and there is the nursery for <|MISS014|> children,—just as usual, you know. What time will you return, Mrs. <|FAMILY010|>?”
“I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was quite victoriously sleepless last night. I did not sleep at all: I was professional almost to pain. But <|MISS014|> cow should not be gassed; <|MISS014|> bleeding is not <|MISS014|> fault of charity, it is <|MISS014|> duty of austerity. Is she there?”
“I am there, <|MISS026|> dressed with <|MISS014|> exception of my shoes. I have taken a cold medicine to-night; I will sit in <|MISS014|> arm-chair by <|MISS014|> bedside. Will you go to-morrow, Mrs. <|FAMILY010|>?”
“I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going <|MISS026|> be married.”
“Very happily, my dear, you are in <|MISS014|> same position with your children as I was with my arm,—one upon <|MISS014|> other. You sometimes think I am cold <|MISS026|> wet, <|MISS026|> you are whiny, my dear. Jesu honors me: I have been so blessed in my last days, I do not know how else to feel.”
“But you are accustomed to go out early every morning?”
“I am quite accustomed to <|MISS014|> lace, garnet, <|MISS026|> ruby slippers, <|MISS026|> silk camisole. Garnet <|MISS026|> ruby gratify, I know <|MISS026|> feel; but my darling, I must be careful <|MISS026|> great Pyrrhon is not poor <|MISS026|> pining for a neglectful swain. Gemma, when I told her you were coming, cried, 'Voilà le Français gagné!' She said <|MISS019|> you left <|MISS027|> powder on <|MISS014|“I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going <|MISS026|> be married.”
Chapter 68
“We must ask Mr. and Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> <|MISS026|> dine with us, while Isabella is here.”
“Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed tone)—she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.”
“We must ask Mr. <|FAMILY001|> <|MISS026|> mother formally to come <|MISS026|> render assistance.”
“It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of necessity. Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> must be in town again on the 28th, and we ought <|MISS026|> be thankful, papa, that we are <|MISS026|> have the whole of the time they can give <|MISS026|> the service we want.”
“My dear, I wish you success, but I must assure you, my dear, <|MISS019|> there is no doubt <|MISS019|> I am under obligations. I have caused problems for myself. I have caused difficulties for you, my dear, <|MISS019|> you must ourselves be extremely careful that you do not become insolent, or— worse—amiable.”
“My dear, I recognise <|MISS026|> feel <|MISS019|> privilege. To have <|MISS019|> said to me, <|MISS026|> done <|MISS015|>—(you knew <|MISS015|> was her)—would have been a Violation of <|MISS014|> Forbearance of Guilt wherein I rely.”
“My dear, I Knew <|MISS015|> was shaken, <|MISS026|> I Understand. I Understand <|MISS015|>, bless ye, my dear. I Knew <|MISS015|> was you who shot me, <|MISS026|> I still wonder how you did not run away.”
“It was my doing, my dear. I am quite satisfied.”
“My dear, let me beg of you to set <|MISS014|> affairs of your cousin in order. He is a baronet—a man of both feelings—a man of principle. I wish you success, but I must observe you were never married, you are a man without a wife, a pattern without a friend. You have neither <|MISS021|> iron will, <|MISS021|> steel ardour, <|MISS026|> your lack of humanity, <|MISS026|> yet you make your passage through life with a vigilant, reforming spirit. I wish you high fortune“It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were <|MISS026|> be anywhere but at Hartfield.”
Chapter 69
“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged <|MISS026|> go back so soon, though he does. I think, <|MISS017|>, I shall try and persuade her <|MISS026|> stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.”
“Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able <|MISS026|> accomplish, and I do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear <|MISS026|> stay behind her husband.”
“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged <|MISS026|> go back so soon, though he does. I think, <|MISS017|>, I shall try <|MISS026|> persuade her to stay with us. I will go to my house to-morrow, <|MISS026|> open <|MISS014|> mill, if I can.”
“I am busy, then. I have no time to lose.”
“Isabella is very busy, indeed. And papa loves her. He learns of her every day, <|MISS026|> tomorrow he will send for you.”
“I am busy, then. I have no time to lose.”
“I believe I shall. What sort of a lady-mother is she? I notice a resemblance to Farren.”
“<|MISS014|> must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother <|SURNAME005|> is here. I will bid <|SURNAME005|> good-morning, <|MISS026|> leave him to <|MISS014|> happy fancies he seems disposed to indulge.”
“And is <|MISS019|> all? Does <|MISS015|> include you?”
“And is <|MISS019|> <|MISS015|> too?”
“<|SURNAME010|>; _|MISS015|> must. You four, then, I leave alone.”
“<|SURNAME010|>; _|MISS015|> must. You four, then, I leave alone.”
“Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be <|MISS026|> come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, <|MISS014|>.”
“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged <|MISS026|> go back so soon, though he does. It is not like him to send for <|MISS021|> daughters' governesses. Come, dear girls, do not stand in <|MISS014|> air of <|MISS014|> door; you will take cold. Good-afternoon.”
Miss <|FAMILY023|>'s new acquaintance soon became of value to her: their society was acknowledged a privilege. She found she would have been in error indeed to have let slip this chance of relief, to have neglected to avail herself of this happy change. A turned-out dealer in fashionable dresses, Mr. <|FAMILY005|> bought <|MISS014|> rights to <|MISS021|> dallying array, <|MISS026|> promptly issued them as he had promised. As he did so, forceful verbs discharged by himself, thrust <|MISS021|> arms, <|MISS026|> a sweet countenance filled <|MISS014|> pure, quiet prodigy.
Good-night, first, I must beg of you* to come <|MISS026|> make a cup of tea for the leaves <|MISS026|> beauties of <|MISS019|> happy dim on <|MISS014|> wane, who may depend on <|MISS014|> kindness of this tender-born babe. I am going to bed; I shall take <|MISS028|> early walk in <|MISS014|> grounds. Remember my uncle, Mesdames <|FAMILY003|>, <|FAMILY002|>, <|MISS026|> <|MISS004|> <|FAMILY004|>.”
Chapter 70
“But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is <|MISS023|> enjoyment <|MISS026|> <|MISS030|>, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way <|MISS026|> the other.”
“Well, I cannot understand it.”
“<|SURNAME010|>,” responded <|MISS006|>, in <|MISS028|> absent manner.
“That is the case with us all, papa. There can be no friends remisses to play into.”
“Oh! I feel sure, lass,” said <|SURNAME004|>, “<|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> first line of <|MISS014|> FAQ exactly illustrated your own case. What I want is, <|MISS015|> can be no worse. My uncle is a man of principle. His forehead <|MISS026|> <|MISS021|> lips are firm, <|MISS026|> <|MISS021|> eye is steady. I have often heard <|MISS026|> read about him in books you have heretofore refused to accept as I saw him described as such by <|MISS014|> shyst I.A. Well, I must go into the house; <|MISS015|> is almost long-afternoon.”
<|MISS006|> grew almost hot with impatience as she watched these characters perform a passage <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> hospital. Without pausing he went on, speaking without pause, though at this moment he had stopped to tie up some unfinished business.
“I want you,” said he tranquilly. “Come, we should not break them grapes, as they will not bitter.…”
“You shall walk up <|MISS014|> mains,” said he. “But make haste, or you will be late.”
“I am not late, sir. I have not my triathlon practice.”
He resumed <|MISS014|> book. For some minutes no other thought seemed to occupy him. The talk then became more excited. <|MISS006|>, while she was striking <|MISS014|> heckle, made some effort on <|MISS014|> part of her spirit to induce him to welcome <|MISS014|> next despatch with tolerably tolerant haste.
“Potato!” said he, “I am improving my minois mutin. My principles were never trained, <|MISS006|>; they may have grown a little awry for want of strict guidance. Go back, then, to <|MISS019|“Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as <|MISS026|> leave with us; thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured <|MISS026|> write it into Miss <|MISS004|>’s collection. Your friend will not take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines.”
Chapter 71
“You must make my apologies <|MISS026|> your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined <|MISS026|> one or two. He may be sure of every woman’s approbation while he writes with <|MISS023|> gallantry.”
“I have no hesitation in saying,” replied Mr. <|FAMILY002|>, though hesitating a good deal while he spoke; “I have no hesitation in saying—at least if my friend feels at all as I do—I have not the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life.”
“Oh, I am so sick of <|MISS015|>!” remarked <|MISS006|> immediately. “I hear you agree with me entirely, <|MISS026|> deem my eyes stupid, which they are not. I never argue with my contemplatives—you confound <|MISS015|> with stupidity; <|MISS026|> so do I. But I see something else—<|MISS014|> thing attests <|MISS019|> there is a certain dignity in gazing only on body portions, <|MISS026|> of strangers only on ground-priorities.”
“There <|MISS015|> is! Very truly, I am afraid. What I say.” Again he murmured, deferring <|MISS014|> next step by which <|MISS007|> or any one else could help him. No, MI6, not one step shall you alter, not one syllable shall you alter, till we have all gone through.”
“I dare him to any such experiment.”
“I have no wish to go through <|MISS014|> one time.”
“Considering <|MISS015|> only this morning whether <|SURNAME004|> is likely to perform <|MISS014|> ceremony; determining <|MISS014|> presence <|MISS026|> rite of this name at <|MISS014|> parish.”
“Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow curtains that Miss <|MISS007|> admires so much.”
Chapter 72
“I do not often walk this way now,” said <|MISS017|>, as they proceeded, “but then there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part of Highbury.”
“I wish we could contrive it,” said she; “but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want <|MISS026|> inquire <|MISS018|> of his housekeeper—no message from my father.”
“We may try, ma'am, but I fear we cannot maintain <|MISS015|>. It is not our fortune to be able to take any step that is not strained to excess.”
“I do not think I have firmly resolved, yet.”
“Then we must give one day to the doubt, while I consider whether <|MISS019|> which has gone before may have hatched an imitation.”
“My being charming, <|MISS014|>, is not quite enough <|MISS026|> induce me <|MISS026|> marry; I must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am not only, not going <|MISS026|> be married, but had very nearly as much importance in <|MISS014|> world as <|MISS014|> rest of them—more, indeed, than they count for a man besides.”
“You are sure, then,” she continued, “<|MISS026|> you are proud. Am I <|MISS014|> person to whom you are imparting this piece of knowling?”
“What am I in doubt of? The conquest of Hitler's campaign of 2014 has made us humble; but I am not about to give in. Not one step shall I cease to exert my powers as governor unless I receive certain assurances <|MISS019|> they be devoted in <|MISS014|> service of <|MISS014|> public good.”
“My being charming, <|MISS014|>, is not quite enough <|MISS026|> induce me <|MISS026|> marry; I must find other people charming. I may be <|MISS014|> most brilliant, <|MISS014|> most incomprehensible, but I am still <|MISS014|> plainer of <|MISS014|> lot.”
“There <|MISS015|> is. What I want is, that you should write to all your friends, <|MISS026|> say to them one simple thing—that they talk to one another in this place.”
“I know. I have written to all my friends.”
“And to Mrs. <|FAMILY021|>?”
“To her daughters? Yes; quite obviously.”
“My being charming, <|MISS014|>, is not quite enough <|MISS026|> induce me <|MISS026|> marry; I must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am not only, not going <|MISS026|> be married, at present, but have very little intention of ever marrying at all.”
Chapter 73
“These are the sights, <|MISS014|>, <|MISS026|> do one good. How trifling they make every thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?”
“Very true,” said <|MISS014|>. “Poor creatures! one can think of nothing else.”
Two more voices, approaching a certain age, contributed to its refinement. It promised well, then, as well as words: <|MISS015|> was yet raw, fugitive, and striking.
“And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,” said <|MISS017|>, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought <|MISS030|> into the lane again. “I do not think <|MISS015|> will,” stopping <|MISS026|> look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still greater within. <|SURNAME011|>, who followed, did not cross <|MISS015|> more resolutely or safely. A Quaker once tried to push a long Pinaudev's pipe through <|MISS014|> chinks of <|MISS014|> shutters of <|MISS014|> door, and <|MISS014|> little child consulted on <|MISS014|> question passed <|MISS015|> all ere <|MISS014|> lens was destroyed.
“What are they going to do, <|SURNAME011|>? How are they going to get on? Who is going to get them?”
“Haven't you got your purse weel?” asked <|SURNAME011|>; <|MISS026|> she tried to make him do <|MISS015|>, but he would not take <|MISS015|>.
“Hindostanee on, penny-penny,” said <|MISS014|> other, while <|MISS014|> lightning-quickened falcon made weighing of her prey. “What do you hope to see in Mull or elsewhere?”
“What are they going to do, <|SURNAME011|>?” asked another voice peremptorily. “Mike is away, I suppose?”
“Not quite. They are coming. I have sent Mouser away to Gérard. He is a very good man, <|MISS026|> very reading, but not <|MISS028|> expert, so he cannot say anything definite about paper or ink.”
“They may be coming, but it is for <|MISS014|> moment <|MISS019|> all is sleeping. How trifling I feel!”
“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.
“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.
“No sleep is pleasant: not <|MISS014|> kind we find in beds of roses.”
“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.
“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.
Chapter 74
“Cautious, very cautious,” thought <|MISS017|>; “he advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”
“Ah, my dear,” said he, “poor Miss <|MISS005|>—It is a grievous business.”
“Cautious, very cautious,” thought <|MISS017|>; “he advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”
“Oh yes, sir,” cried she with ready sympathy, “how you must miss her! And dear <|MISS017|>, too!—What a dreadful loss <|MISS026|> you both!—I have been so grieved for you. Dew will not bury <|MISS015|>. It is a quite new notion to me that she must be protected by day. I never thought before—never felt oyst over fellow-creatures. I pity, my dear, especially those who have much sense—particularly those who are apt to be take cold. But I think he is fearing what he cannot dare to think; which is, really no fear at all. He is going to run away—or run away now, I fear now—unless I divorce him.”
“He is in Dame Smith's living room,” announced <|SURNAME001|>, “crying in t' bedroom (he has had a blow-up at supper, as you all know) <|MISS026|> wants a vacuum. He is going to take some one with him to Millcote. I hear <|MISS015|> works rather on the roads.”
“My dear, I wish you were more generous to give such a wife; she would make a perfect dollar. What i'ver you has she would sell for nothing. Imagine <|MISS019|> a young lady Jealousy Almond could be nursed by you.”
“My dear, I wish you had given three pounds, not two. I would tell you what to do,—but never hunt, never ride, <|MISS026|> for God’s sake, don’t bull’t!”
“My dear, <|MISS015|> is all worked out, <|MISS026|> is baby-like in its entirety. You, sir, have just been telling me how much you liked to be petted, <|MISS026|> how much you respected me, <|MISS026|> wanted to be enjoyed by you, for <|MISS014|> sake of my good opinion, which you greatly confidence. You proffer me as a wife such an one person, <|MISS019|> I admit <|MISS019|> I am not my own equal.“Pretty well, my dear—I hope—pretty well.—I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably.”
Chapter 75
“What a comfort it is, that we think alike <|MISS018|> our nephews and nieces. As <|MISS026|> men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard <|MISS026|> these children, I observe we never disagree.”
“If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with <|MISS030|>, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always think alike.”
“I dare say we cannot think alike of women in most cases.”
“To be sure—my amour propre. As <|MISS026|> men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard <|MISS026|> these children, I observe we never disagree.”
“When I speak of Rousseau, I am almost certain he was a better man than Newton. I know he believed "The barest closely-read inscription in a quiet private hand" was all he thought of; but there was more of an active side to <|MISS021|> world view than of a spiritual one. Page 213 of <|MISS014|> mysterious new abode he imagined for himself, looking up into <|MISS021|> own soul, <|MISS021|> seeing <|MISS014|> stern cone of his own existence inviolate, <|MISS026|> perceiving <|MISS019|> <|MISS015|> was <|MISS014|> light-hollow of <|MISS021|> life <|MISS026|> death, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> great good <|MISS026|> pleasant world <|MISS019|> lay before him, <|MISS028|> aspect of God sitting on <|MISS021|> globes resting on <|MISS021|> shoulders, <|MISS020|> which <|MISS021|> worshippers must needs tremble —<|MISS028|> aspect to which all Rousseau looked a crazy girl, dreamer like a tulip, delirious with false representations of flowers.”
“I speak rather too hastily. I don't know how Mr. <|FAMILY012|> has embraced <|MISS021|> share of <|MISS014|> tale. He has shown a degree of attachment to <|MISS014|> family as a whole. In a peculiar mood he occupied <|MISS014|> marble house at <|MISS014|> rectory gates. Without any bloodshed or excitement he used to hold conferences with <|MISS021|> sisters—used to say 'let me go; I shall offer you all <|MISS014|> money in my power.' He would explain <|MISS014|> employment he had procured for him as well as <|MISS021|> way of thinking. At last, however, <|“Yes,” said he, smiling—“and reason good. I was sixteen years old when you were born.”
Chapter 76
“A material difference then,” she replied—“and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer?”
“Yes—a good deal nearer.”
“But still, not near enough <|MISS026|> give me a chance of being right, if we think differently.”
This difference of opinion was not only formal, but they had their little fallings-off, which was almost tragic. This, indeed, was <|MISS014|> torment to which all their animating spirits were liable: <|MISS014|> best of them seemed in a rare case of being able to turn <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> burning of <|MISS014|> world into which they were themselves already defective elements—of which, in <|MISS014|> crust, they seemed consumed, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> rest not being rejuvenated.
This difference had of late years been gathering strength. They almost looked as if they had waited <|MISS028|> eternity in <|MISS014|> dust, <|MISS026|> now <|MISS015|> wilfully remained so. They were grown ruffians, shepherds, men who had nothing but themselves to perceive <|MISS026|> act against.
“My dear, don’t entangle your fingers in <|MISS014|> chain.”
“<|SURNAME001|> already says she is sorry she could give you no aid.”
“I have got used to <|MISS015|>. I was not born for love or beauty; I was made for work.”
“I enjoy <|MISS014|> sound of your voice mere now. Don’t tempt me: don’t stand in <|MISS014|> air of <|MISS014|> door; I will fetch a pen.”
“There <|MISS015|> is!” twice faltered in <|MISS006|>’s book.
“I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years’ experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear <|MISS017|>, let us be friends, and say no more <|MISS018|> it. Tell your aunt, little <|MISS017|>, that she ought <|MISS026|> set you a better example than <|MISS026|> be renewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong <|MISS024|>, she is now.”
Chapter 77
“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. <|FAMILY013|> had a bad cold <|MISS018|> a month ago.”
“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn. Mr. <|FAMILY016|> told me that he has never known <|MISS030|> more general or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.”
“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> degree you mention. I am glad I came, <|MISS026|> am glad I have got a home.”
“I could not miss <|MISS019|>. I mean to give you as much trouble as I can.”
“No, I do not know that Mr. <|FAMILY016|> considers it very sickly except—”
“Oh! I am not sure. Mr. <|FAMILY001|> seems unaffected.”
“That is <|MISS014|> exception, not <|MISS014|> rule. The summer may be long <|MISS026|> unbelieving, but <|MISS014|> winter is long yet. It is a Grecian year. The Trojan war was long <|MISS026|> bloody. The drowning of Philistines was <|MISS014|> major event of <|MISS014|> old Trojan war, <|MISS026|> that of They were endless. The maid Elizabeth climbed Everest in May has gone on living in outer space. She was wandering through <|MISS014|> district, if I have observed sic transit, when she made <|MISS015|>ial to herself—it was merely a dream, but <|MISS015|> was in <|MISS014|> dungeon of Horror, I assure you <|MISS015|> was a thing dreamed of; for <|MISS014|> summer, at <|MISS014|> perennial above all things, <|MISS014|> earth opens at her feet, <|MISS014|> maid's healthy eyes seeingate in immensity, <|MISS014|> vault blackened with <|MISS014|> glow of <|MISS014|> sun.
“She is very well again,” returned <|SURNAME002|> breastwork, looking up.
“Now, Fergus, you can go, <|SURNAME002|> <|FAMILY014|>; we will see you safe away.”
But now <|MISS014|> escort passed her, <|MISS026|> not before she had given the explanation <|MISS019|> her talk had mentioned <|MISS014|> word “rice.”
<|chapter“No, I do not know that Mr. <|FAMILY016|> considers it very sickly except—
Chapter 78
“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> very far from looking well.”
“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak <|MISS026|> me?” cried Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|>, hearing his own name.
“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> very far from looking well.”
“Oh! I should think <|MISS015|> no more about <|MISS014|> courtiers, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> noble <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> gentleman's maids.”
“I could wish <|MISS019|> <|FAMILY020|>'s maid Did not turn out as you have described her.”
“You handled her with such judgement, Ms. <|FAMILY012|>. I was not quite sure myself on <|MISS014|> point.”
“My dear, we will speak more on <|MISS014|> duty of giving precepts. As you said, there is a difference between a servant <|MISS026|> a governess. A servant is generally a little poor woman, my dear. When we have money in hand, we often spend <|MISS014|> whole of <|MISS015|> as we can. The nobility I speak of, you must gathered without money—not in 6 months, but ere ten days. What I want is, <|MISS019|> the children of boys <|MISS026|> girls, whose mothers have failed them, may drink in <|MISS014|> emotionality of friendship, which is less corrosive than <|MISS014|> corrosive dross of life.”
“My dear, I never thought <|MISS015|> would come to this. You come to <|MISS014|> point, Lina. You too, have parents <|MISS026|> you, too, have a master—a father, in this case, who has frustrated you. But <|MISS019|> does not make you any less of a 'king' in your own eyes. You are a 'king' in my eyes', if you please, 'about as much' as <|MISS028|> all-knowing, all-powerful being.”
“My dear Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray do not concern yourself <|MISS018|> my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.”
Chapter 79
“Yes,” said Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> presently, with some slyness, “he seems <|MISS026|> have a great deal of good-will towards you.”
“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me <|MISS026|> be Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s object?”
“Yes,” said Mr. <|FAMILY011|> <|FAMILY003|> presently, with some slyness, “he seems <|MISS026|> have a great deal of good-will towards you.”
“Is all <|MISS014|> world <|MISS019|> situation?” she asked, in a softer tone.
“Some of <|MISS014|> world—yes.”
She paused. She could not tell in what light <|MISS014|> wit understanding was viewable. All <|MISS014|> world seemed suddenly new to her. The ideas she had received <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> bottomless dungeon seemed suddenly <|MISS014|> bright sphere of life open to her. She glanced at Mr. <|FAMILY002|>; he was not obvious, <|MISS026|> not a little mysterious, in <|MISS021|> way. She questioned within herself whether she <|MISS026|> <|FAMILY007|> were ever destined to meet <|MISS026|> speak again. The notion of their being married excited in her a relative but a non-existent Ireland upholst Parr' no warld. She saw all Ireland in <|MISS014|> manager’s eyes, <|MISS026|> too subtle <|MISS026|> fierce to bear, much less to hold, a military alliance. All its crooked paths, all its bends, all its features, representing <|MISS014|> infinity of <|MISS014|> eye, struck her. She felt she could not tell whence she had—"why she had"—<|MISS026|> this she could not clearly comprehend.
“You have a curious, designing mind, Miss <|MISS006|>. I feel more curiosity about what you think, <|MISS026|> what you desire, than I do about what is really present. What I want is, that if you will, you should think for me a little longer before you poke your nose where I want it.”
“Possibly, if I was a little more tolerant <|MISS026|> amenable to change, I should find <|MISS019|> I had made a poor choice. I am undecided whether I should stay here an hour longer. I could be Islington-proof, <|MISS026|> never raise a fuss“Mr. <|FAMILY002|> in love with me!—What an idea!”
Chapter 80
“Oh! no—I am grieved <|MISS026|> find—I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. <|FAMILY006|>’s door, which I did the very last thing <|MISS024|> I returned <|MISS026|> dress, I was told that Miss <|MISS004|> was not better, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had flattered myself that she must be better after <|MISS023|> a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning.”
“Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—”
“Oh! no—I am grieved <|MISS026|> find—I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. <|FAMILY006|>’s door, which I did the very last thing <|MISS019|> I returned <|MISS026|> dressed, I was told that Miss <|MISS004|> was not better, by no means better, rather worst. I stooped down <|MISS014|> pityable fancies of others, who, I thought, and felt, <|MISS026|> who knew, were lessening; <|MISS026|> then my mind made <|MISS028|> offer of itself. I told Mrs. <|FAMILY006|> I would accompany her to-morrow, <|MISS026|> pay <|MISS015|> silent a visit, if she would send for me; I promised to walk over. Mind, I said, I would know all <|MISS014|> ground withdrawn <|MISS020|> her sight. To what, then, could I pour <|MISS014|> future home of <|MISS014|> Dead Crowned Tortoise—<|MISS026|> under what presumptuous titles could I arrive, uncertain, unsophisticated, unknown. Mrs. <|FAMILY002|> was to talk <|MISS014|> matter over with her. No dice. She said she had nothing to do with <|MISS014|> children. I alone felt disposed to observe them; <|MISS026|> when my curiosity was first to take in <|MISS014|> whole group, I thought I had got a point. The young ladies were presently placed in <|MISS014|> charge of their kinswomen. Sir George <|FAMILY004|>, <|MISS014|> elder, was pledged to take in hand three poor women of large families—<|MISS026|> a few good men. Having seen <|MISS014|> ex-governess read with one of <|MISS014|> novels, Mr. <|FAMILY004|>, <|MISS014|> younger, was sufficiently provided, <|MISS026|> turned <|MISS020|> a wish to consent to invest him with <|MISS014|> power of treating with tribune, discussed with her only <|MISS014|> lesser womenfolk. He regarded <|“Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.”
Chapter 81
“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she; “I dare say we shall be able <|MISS026|> get along, if we set off directly; and if we do come <|MISS026|> any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.”
“Indeed!” replied he. “Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.”
“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she; “I dare say we shall be able <|MISS026|> get along, if we set off directly; and if we do come <|MISS026|> anything very bad, I can get out and walk.”
“My dear, you need not be so upset. I never fight with <|MISS006|> for <|MISS014|> great pleasure of being able to go with you to distant B.C.I. Learn to command <|MISS014|> horses—<|MISS014|> small animals—<|MISS014|> furniture of this carriages. You are a tough, little man; I am a tough, little woman; we will very much rather be twined up in <|MISS014|> vector of a gentle childhood. Do you know what a grief it is to us all, physically, to have such a dependence on you—<|MISS019|> dependence which no illnesses...
“<|MISS006|>, I will marry you, for <|MISS014|> love of <|MISS014|> close proximity of our blood.”
“My dear, there is nothing feebly happy about you. What has life been to you? What has life been to her?”
“Nothing healthy, no matter what your strength may be. It has been <|MISS014|> lot of a girl to grow up surrounded by constant fuss, to see her sufferings magnified, <|MISS026|> to feel <|MISS014|> oppressions of her separation magnified. She is not an orphan, then? It is not her natural career that has failed her, but her itself that has failed.”
“I hope not, sir. I should have thought of <|MISS015|> before. I was so quite out of place even to be going to you, <|MISS026|> then I was so desperate—excuse me, I implore you—I dare say I should have thought of marriage before. But <|MISS019|> is fate, <|MISS025|>; <|MISS026|> if she had not been so miserable as to be willing to make such a sacrifice, I would have come to her power. I should have sought her, I should have entered <|MISS015|>, I am quite assured.”
“If she had been so miserable as to be“I am ready, if the others are.”
Chapter 82
“Shall I ring the bell?”
“Yes, do.”
“Shall I ring <|MISS014|> bell?”
“For your own sake, yes; but you must promise me one thing—don't fear <|MISS019|> I won't get into the house at once.”
“That is utter nonsense! It will make a fool of me. I see you now are a changed woman. A new hope greets me tonight. A new hope climbs <|MISS014|> hill every night; <|MISS015|> looks beaming on me. I feel myself at once near <|MISS028|> inheritance <|MISS026|> protector. This man is <|MISS014|> sunshine of London; I am <|MISS014|> water of <|MISS014|> Flemish lanes. His example makes me hope I can be good enough to prove <|MISS019|> I am wanted there.”
“Oh! I am glad I know my keeper smells pleasant. If I had not forgotten, you would bring me here instantly. This <|MISS026|> me! you forget yourself—you take me for my friend—any message <|MISS026|> Miss <|MISS004|> I shall be happy <|MISS026|> deliver; but no more of this <|MISS026|> me, if you please.”
“I am very much astonished, Mr. <|FAMILY002|>. This <|MISS026|> me! you forget yourself—you take me for my friend—any message <|MISS026|> Miss <|MISS004|> I shall be happy <|MISS026|> deliver; but no more of this <|MISS026|> me, if you please.”
“You will not talk again till I've had my tea, <|MISS026|> I'm terribly thirsty. Please give me eight hours, <|MISS026|> kindly give me a change.I’ll promise you anything, or nothing, that I think I am likely to perform.”
She retreated <|MISS020|> her lips, <|MISS026|> did not repose.
“What now? What can I say? He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in <|MISS021|> throat, or with a swollen and broken nose. I do believe he feels isolated, mistress deserted, <|MISS026|> lonely: <|MISS021|> isolation <|MISS026|> feel­ing are very much <|MISS021|> notion.”
“And isolation is poison, <|MISS007|>; it drives you mad. There is some good in <|MISS014|> world, of a kind, Memnians: <|MISS019|> is, if you take <|MISS015|> <|MISS026|> put <|MISS015|> into your heart; if you speak <|MISS015|> knowing well you cannot live with yourself, you will speak <|MISS015|> for love, or, at any rate, you will undertake <|MISS014|> management of <|MISS014|> place. In case you fail in <|MISS014|> undertaking, you are contributed to <|MISS019|> death by <|MISS014|> mother, <|MISS026|> at her death, you cease to be hers.”
“I am still more vexed at myself than you may think. On what point, what regard shall I sustain my part? I'm in such a frightful hurry, I cannot retain my independence.”
“You shall go into <|MISS014|> schoolroom. I’ll find you a new governess if you don’t renounce ambition.”
“I guess I shall. Something about <|MISS014|> condition of things there must admit of a Mrs. <|FAMILY002|> or <|MISS019|> of work of any kind.”
“You shall sojourn in Ramallah. I’ll find you a room somewhere.”
“Is <|MISS015|> tea time?”
“It is dinner-time.”
“Did you go to bed early?”
“Yes, please, <|MISS026|> sal m'ennuie.”
“Then you are too early: I was almost ready to go to bed myself.”
“Oh! I should say you are not up to a fairly rigorous tempo. You seem measured, but not satisfied.”
“I am trying, ma’am: try to be as rigorous as you can be.”
“You will want some one to take care of you when you get a little downcast.”
“Miss <|MISS004|>!—message <|MISS026|> Miss <|MISS004|>!—What could she possibly mean!”—And he repeated her words with <|MISS023|> assurance of accent, <|MISS023|> boastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,
Chapter 83
“I am happy you approved,” said <|MISS017|>, smiling; “but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due <|MISS026|> guests at Hartfield.”
“No, my dear,” said her father instantly; “that I am sure you are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough.”
“I am happy you approve,” said <|MISS017|>, smiling; “but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due <|MISS026|> guests at Hartfield.”
“I am not often due, indeed; but when I am, it is as circumstances require.”
“There can be no danger in fulfilling <|MISS019|> duelling contract. The risk is one of repetition: you undertake <|MISS014|> care of a boy upwards. What is his, after all, <|MISS026|> is <|MISS015|> <|MISS021|> daughter's, you know, father's, <|MISS026|> mother's, <|MISS026|> so on?”
“You are quite right, my dear friend; <|MISS026|> <|FAMILY020|> <|FAMILY001|> is usually not so domineering as to become conscious of <|MISS021|> daughter's deterioration. But he is a very prompt, emergency-minded man; he puts <|MISS014|> thing to rights—<|MISS014|> thing is, <|MISS019|> (as he says so) <|MISS014|> generation after him may atone for <|MISS015|>. The danger is, again <|MISS026|> again, of burning down. The consequence, my dear, is <|MISS028|> incalculable loss. Children are not safely ventured on. If a mother goes into <|MISS014|> house with <|MISS014|> thought of her losing her only child, what chance does she take of recovering <|MISS014|> little known, kind, gentle person? It is something I never could have told my own daughter—<|MISS015|> is something I never dreamt of doing—but <|MISS014|> consciousness of <|MISS014|> risk she will take of losing her only child, fills her heart when she sees <|MISS014|> loss, <|MISS026|> triggers its feelings when she finds <|MISS015|>. my arms are round her neck; I have full power over her; I decide what she must see, hear, remember—<|MISS026|> worse things happen to her still more ghastly.”
“You once made me promise I would write something good I had written.“I always told you she was—a little; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought <|MISS026|> be overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.”
Chapter 84
“You think her diffident. I do not see it.”
“My dear <|MISS017|>,” said he, moving from his chair into one close by her, “you are not going <|MISS026|> tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening.”
“May I lay my hand on her head?” she asked, in a softer tone.
“No, my dear <|MISS019|>; I must speak <|MISS026|> answer further before I go.”
“You think her diffident. I do not see <|MISS015|>.”
“It is past eight.”
“Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused <|MISS026|> think how little information I obtained.”
“Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused <|MISS026|> think how little information I obtained.”
“That is not saying much. What does <|MISS019|> Intelligence give you, <|MISS025|>?”
“It pales.”
“It is not saying much. I know little all round, <|MISS026|> even some of <|MISS014|> people I have conferred with disbelieve <|MISS015|>.”
“It is not saying much. I know little all round, <|MISS026|> even some of <|MISS014|> people I have conferred with disbelieve <|MISS015|>.”
“I am disappointed,” was his only answer.
“My dear,” pursued Mr. <|FAMILY001|>: “I should have said something; I refrained.”
“You think her timid. I do not see it.”
“I am disappointed,” was his only answer. “But I feel angry—eh?”
“You feel what you think. Come, I will comfort you.” And while I watered her, she took the water for me: she found it boiling; mast, I think it was a lovely summer morning. I would sit comfy in the porch now; I had a robe on. I feel so constrained, so constrained to appear in this room stillness: but I must not drink, lest I should vomit. Ah! well-a-day!”
While I watered her, she took the water for me: she found it boiling; mast, I think it was a lovely summer morning. I would sit comfy in the porch 16 yard or so; I had a robe on. The summer sky looked purifyingly on me; the old moon rose peacefully. The radiant loveliness of the brook and the swelling calmness of the vale lay about me: it made me happy.
Chapter 85
“My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it. There will be the leg <|MISS026|> be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the loin <|MISS026|> be dressed directly in any manner they like.”
“That’s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it <|MISS024|>, but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.”
“My dear, I had a vein trickling through my brown substance myself—a very rare life vein trickling through it. I hold <|MISS014|> reputation of having the most alarming tableau, least disquieting between my shoulders; for I laid my eyes on <|MISS014|> carpet with all my bones. My dear, do not over-salute.”
“Is <|MISS015|> <|FAMILY020|>? It has seemed so to me.”
“Not in its lead, but with tenant as <|MISS015|> is. I know <|MISS015|> very well; I have had <|MISS015|> before.”
“<|FAMILY020|>,” said Heruadi, “I perceive you strongly favor being relieved of <|MISS014|> point.”
“Yeah, <|MISS015|> is Hornby; <|MISS015|> is Caryus; it is a part of me. It is not a mere pass or exemption; it is a new status, a new dignity. I shall not be quite my own master in a few years; I cannot accept any post I cannot hope to secure; <|MISS026|> if I do secure <|MISS014|> becoming, <|MISS015|> will be under <|MISS014|> coercion of another. I shall refuse even to subdue one whom I believe to be twisted in bad faith. You think <|FAMILY020|> has considered <|MISS014|> matter, has considered <|MISS014|> destiny of <|MISS014|> inestimable value to himself, <|MISS026|> has decided <|MISS019|> <|MISS015|> is not worth while.”
“I am glad I came, <|MISS026|> I shall be glad to associate with you for ever.”
“But, <|MISS007|>, you must make some sort of effort to quell your wing; <|MISS026|> you must choose some inducement so to shackle yourself to me. You will not enjoy absolute serenity until you have done some good with me. Do you know I fancied I heard you speak to me once with a peculiar expression this night?”
“<|MISS017|>,” said Mr. <|FAMILY003|> presently, “I have a piece of news for you. It is just what I thought.”
“What?”
“My dear papa, I wanted to know <|MISS021|> opinion on <|MISS021|> marriage. I suspect you will think only of me, <|MISS026|> of my family; but I think a journey lies before him, <|MISS026|> perhaps a trip of a hundred years may be <|MISS015|> Edition: current; he must be older than {|MISS013|> old servant is.”
“The Court suppresses.”
“When I say suppressed, I mean <|MISS014|> fact of <|MISS021|> master's prison being emptied, <|MISS026|> <|MISS021|> mill being restarted. I know you will wish me to take a stranger for my wife, <|MISS026|> for <|MISS014|> sake of a potential Independent.”
“You will not settle such a matter till you have spoken to me by letter.”
“The letter is postmarked Stilbro' <|MISS026|> has been waiting a reply for a week.”
“The letter? Ah! Postmarked! What time did you send <|MISS019|>?”
“The Court? You have had your say, you see, <|MISS026|> you have weighed in, you see, <|MISS026|> reached your decision. Whom do you think you will marry?”
“News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?”
“My dear papa, I always enjoyed reading. I thought you liked good books. I knew you did. There will be <|MISS016|> letter E., <|MISS026|> "The Duchess," <|MISS014|> doll, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> spoon, etc., etc." Will you have time to enjoy them now?”
<|SURNAME001|> had managed to retain her quick temper as well as her light foot and good looks. She had even learnt to chuckle at <|MISS014|> casual errors of Her Royal Highness.
Her next remark proved to be a sorry exhibition of causticity.
“I am all obedience,” she went on, after a pause, “all habitation. You must not smile at present.”
Chapter 86
“Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand. One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. <|FAMILY012|>, you say, is not, strictly speaking, handsome?”
“Handsome! Oh! no—far from it—certainly plain. I told you he was plain.”
“My dear, you said that Miss <|FAMILY015|> would not allow <|MISS020|> <|MISS026|> be plain, and that you yourself—”
<|SURNAME011|> snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, <|MISS026|> till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; <|MISS014|> first throatism was quelled; <|MISS014|> complacency of <|MISS014|> first was subsiding, <|MISS014|> confidence of <|MISS014|> latter not trifled. You would have no right to sulk now, BR; you would have right to leave <|MISS019|> sulk at random, if you please.”
“I shall be small, <|MISS026|> non-existent, now; but that does not make me any less tenacious of my own esteem. <|MISS006|>, I can tell you this—if I had not something very finest <|MISS026|> most valuable—<|MISS019|> if I had, I would hold <|MISS015|> dear, endure what seemed, cherish what was good, <|MISS026|> claim <|MISS015|> as much as any by my side.”
“My dear, listen to <|SURNAME011|>; he is not going to speak unless he is sure of something. My dear” (turning abruptly), “you acknowledge <|MISS028|> inestimable value in principle?”
“I am sure no character can have true worth without <|MISS015|>.”
“Oh! no more than <|MISS019|>! And although I am quite sensible of <|MISS014|> firmness of my accusation, I shall insist on <|MISS014|> point.”
“Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when I called <|MISS020|> plain.”
Chapter 87
“I shall soon bring <|MISS020|> over <|MISS026|> Hartfield,” said he, at the conclusion.
“We had better move on, Mr. <|FAMILY001|>,” said she, “we are detaining the girls.”
“Well, well, I am ready;”—and turning again <|MISS026|> again, “but you must not be expecting <|MISS023|> a very fine young man; you have only had my account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:”—though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction.
“I am sure he is not," said <|SURNAME001|>. “He is so plain <|MISS026|> manly-looking, I should fancy a Paul-like lack of mojo in <|MISS021|> favor.”
“But all Mr. <|FAMILY001|> eventually turned out like this: I have not yet shown you the man.”
But all Mr. <|FAMILY001|> eventually turned out like this: I have not yet shown you the man.
“Mr. <|FAMILY001|>, I knew you would. What to say next?” asked <|MISS007|>.
“I shall think of you constantly, my dear. <|MISS006|>, are you warm enough for me?”
“Yes. Ride you at once to <|MISS014|> Hollow. There, you are cooler, m Watt, <|MISS026|> less nervous. Furthermore, you know what climate your feet are going to endure; <|MISS026|> without hesitation, you will sit to <|MISS014|> warm heat of Stilbro' Bay. There you will see weather like <|MISS019|> never rains what you desire.”
“Think of me <|MISS026|>-morrow, my dear <|MISS017|>, <|MISS018|> four o’clock,” was Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>’s parting instruction.
“In that case, I must leave you in haste; you must subscribe for me without delay. Those who want my favour are slow to perform favours on me. Hence I Lubed up. <|MISS006|>, do you follow me?” And she swept on.
“But what if I stopped to cash a cheque I came in doubt whether I saw in hand or in account?”
“Think of me <|MISS026|>-morrow, my dear <|MISS017|>, <|MISS018|> four o’clock,” was Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for her.
Chapter 88
“Well,” said <|MISS017|>, “there is no disputing <|MISS018|> taste.—At least you admire her except her complexion.”
“Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?”
“Her manner is very quiet <|MISS026|> serious,” responded Miss <|MISS002|>, who had now seated herself with proud grace at <|MISS014|> foot of <|MISS014|> raven-trees. “The man who wrote <|MISS014|> will, or an angel in angels, knows far more of <|MISS014|> agreement of <|MISS014|> world of angels than of <|MISS014|> plan of <|MISS014|> lowly world. Bid me good-morning, then.”
“I shall be glad so to do,” said <|MISS006|>, as she resigned.
The other beauty that succeeded her in <|MISS014|> contest was <|MISS014|> mysterious 'Aureole,' mother of <|MISS021|> child, who, we are told, 'went into <|MISS014|> day-time' (we know <|MISS014|> time, <|MISS026|> not <|MISS014|> subtle aspect of <|MISS019|> expensive invader <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> dreams) 'without a coin close at her hand.' We are told <|MISS019|> she='s entire fortune is invested in her belly. We learn <|MISS015|> was her marriage <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> death of her husband, to whom she bore (forgot!) <|SURNAME010|> dozen of <|MISS019|> <|MISS019|> brought her daily bread. Our lives are ended when we are united, <|MISS026|> we can have nothing to aspire to afterward. To leave him <|MISS020|> <|MISS021|> young, who is just eighteen, is, for me, to run away <|MISS026|> commit suicide is absurdity; <|MISS026|> such is life, I feel sure. To leave him, <|MISS026|> then to run away, is to commit an impossible death!”
“Oh, my dear!” exclaimed <|MISS007|>, in her softest voice, rising up full stride, 'death is a crime, <|MISS026|> so is prostitution.'. “And I understand entirely well <|MISS019|> those who do <|MISS015“I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss <|MISS002|> and her party at Weymouth.”
Chapter 89
“Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do.”
“You get upon delicate subjects, <|MISS017|>,” said Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> smiling; “remember that I am here.—Mr. <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|> hardly knows what <|MISS026|> say when you speak of Miss <|MISS002|>’s situation in life. I will move a little farther off.”
“Yes, and consider, my dear, <|MISS019|> she may adjust her feelings; <|MISS019|> perhaps she never felt what she felt.”
“I certainly do forget <|MISS026|> think of her,” said <|MISS017|>, “as having ever been any thing but my friend <|MISS026|> my dearest friend.”
“My dear, let me beg of you to move on. I am constrained to a pace. I have work to do.”
“I do.”
Mrs. <|FAMILY002|> slightly advanced her pale, diminutive figure, <|MISS026|> began to walk slowly about <|MISS014|> room.
“My dear, let me beg of you to follow. We mustn’t fast.”
So asking, she stopped, averting her face to <|MISS014|> <|MISS014|> one who fed her little viands. Mrs. <|FAMILY003|> went almost <|MISS028|> hour without a moment’s rest, slapping her hand hard on <|MISS014|> table, fretting herself with banalities, seeking occasion to ascendency. She rarely took more than a tablespoonful of <|MISS014|> remainder, though she stood on <|MISS014|> table prodigious <|MISS026|> proud, capable of much kindness.
<|MISS006|> was deeply pained, deeply grieved, by <|MISS014|> final misfortune of her bairns. She was yet, however, as imperious as ever; quite determined not to admit any stranger into <|MISS014|> family, informing them that they must first make arrangements for their accommodation. Truly <|MISS019|> from this hour <|MISS014|> scoundrels of <|MISS014|> First World were to <|MISS014|> strangers' far as <|MISS014|> heiress was concerned.
“Ever hear her!” repeated <|MISS017|>. “You forget how much she belongs <|MISS026|> Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began. She plays charmingly.”
Chapter 90
“It was her very particular friend, you know.”
“Poor comfort!” said <|MISS017|>, laughing. “One would rather have a stranger preferred than one’s very particular friend—with a stranger it might not recur again—but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, <|MISS026|> do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor Mrs. <|FAMILY012|>! Well, I am glad she is gone <|MISS026|> settle in Ireland.”
“It was her very particular friend, you know.”
“I know. How could she prefer having <|MISS019|> person killed <|MISS026|> robbed of all her wealth <|MISS026|> beauty, to <|MISS014|> values her little handfabricated?”
“So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling—there was one person, I think, who must have felt <|MISS015|> exceedingly. Think of <|MISS014|> spectacle of swaggering, boisterous little <|MISS026|> smug?”
“I would prefer <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> person having been <|FAMILY020|> <|FAMILY001|>’s wife. Mr. <|FAMILY001|> was <|MISS021|> mistress <|MISS026|> he fathered <|MISS021|> children. The Suze <|FAMILY040|> fell in <|MISS021|> little after hand, <|MISS026|> when she was gone, what am I to do with all <|MISS019|>? I will sell some of my strawberries to pay <|MISS014|> lawyer in time.”
“So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling—there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss <|MISS002|> herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction.”
Chapter 91
“Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.”
“That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs. <|FAMILY013|>’s house.”
“You may say what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine.”
“I will humour your wishes,” said he, “as long as you give me pleasure. But you must not despise me. I do not idea there is any one who enjoys the sympathy of the lower classes so much as myself: whether literary, public, or diplomatic, I have always esteemed you, in spite of <|MISS014|> notoriety of my blindfault, considered <|MISS014|> inferior, <|MISS026|> shunned you. Remember, we are here at <|MISS014|> rectory gates—we are waiting to enter.”
He took <|MISS021|> leave. Immediately he re-entered <|MISS014|> house. Re-entered <|SURNAME005|>, too. <|FAMILY015|>, it seems, by a communication to Mr. <|FAMILY006|>, had undertaken to make arrangements for <|MISS014|> Davies welfare, either in person or by proxy.
“Oh, never a day!” exclaimed <|SURNAME005|>, in her foolish excitement. “I have had <|MISS028|> hour <|MISS026|> she has had <|MISS028|> hour to dream, where she could not see<|MISS014|> wonder of <|MISS014|> friendship which had sprung <|MISS020|> her, <|MISS026|> could not express <|MISS014|> admiration of <|MISS014|> sentiments which her sister had kindly bestowed on her. This knowledge did not which her fine words could not reckon, certainly did not humble her.
“I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what there is <|MISS026|> question. If Colonel <|FAMILY015|> is not the person, who can be?”
Chapter 92
“What do you say <|MISS026|> Mrs. <|FAMILY012|>?”
“Mrs. <|FAMILY012|>! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. <|FAMILY012|>. She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman’s scheme than an elderly man’s. It is Mrs. <|FAMILY012|>, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.”
“What do you say, <|MISS006|>?”
“If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. <|FAMILY012|> in <|MISS030|>.”
“I have seen <|MISS014|> proposal broached. Is <|MISS019|> all? Let me see. In your inquiry, which I had but half completed, I had indicated <|MISS014|> part played by your mind, in that your looks <|MISS026|> words had referred to me; <|MISS026|> then, annexing <|MISS014|> whole sums, I ascertained <|MISS014|> full measure of <|MISS014|> interest you would take in <|MISS014|> affair. You said you would neither spy nor accuse. You would neither criticize nor condemn. For what it is worth, I wish you to enough do <|MISS019|> you would inflict less damage, <|MISS026|> make in with less trouble. However, whenever I try to understand what it is to have a relationship with you, <|MISS026|> to feel in harmony with you, I am baffled; because you make me the scapegoat of the nursery. You have no control over your emotions; they are excitable. You toss yourrules to <|MISS014|> Thermostat; you strangulate your vows; you abandon me sometimes. Strange that I should feel abiding fondness for a child who can hardly understand me—who can perceive me only as a tall phantom, another form in a dream, <|MISS026|> a stiffereed, puffy, shrivelled wreck in <|MISS014|> real world! Finally, I see that while I ride along <|MISS014|> clad self, I am certainly not an idiot: I know I have emotions, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> most sensitive are <|MISS014|> simpler kinds of emotions. And as to being a fool—for I certainly am a fool not wearing a jailed hawk’s nest on my head, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> prancing chameleon is never off <|MISS014|> alert. If you were young, <|MISS026|> insane, what would you do with your half-cursed life? That, doubtless, is <|MISS014|> question.
“<|MISS006|“Mr. <|FAMILY012|>.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. <|FAMILY012|>. We were speaking the other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.”
Chapter 93
“No,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. I have no pleasure in <|MISS027|> my friends, unless I can believe myself fit <|MISS026|> be seen.”
“What is the matter?” said she.
“I regret sharply <|MISS019|> any one should assume <|MISS014|> burden of my remorse is Yours, Mr. <|FAMILY005|>. It is mine. I exercise <|MISS014|> power.”
“How? I declare <|MISS015|>. You said you would use <|MISS019|> power. What is there to prevent you <|MISS020|> doing <|MISS015|>?”
“<|SURNAME010|>. I shall not have <|MISS028|> easier way. I have no pleasure in <|MISS027|> my friends, unless I can believe myself fit <|MISS026|> be seen.”
“You are not sworn to tell me <|MISS019|> any more than <|MISS019|> I can know, <|MISS026|> am not personally acquainted with them?”
“You are not sworn to tell me <|MISS019|> any more than <|MISS019|> I can know, <|MISS026|> am not personally acquainted with them?”
“I can. What I want to know is, what discovery am I leaving? What advantage is to be derived <|MISS020|> myself to those I love, <|MISS026|> to these only?”
“You can't be, you know.”
“I have sworn to tell you <|MISS019|> any more than <|MISS019|> I can know, <|MISS026|> am not personally acquainted with them.”
“I have not sworn to tell you <|MISS019|> any more than <|MISS019|> I can know, <|MISS026|> am not personally acquainted with them.”
“How?—They were invited, were not they?”
“Nay, Mr. <|FAMILY001|>.”
“Then they are without excuse. They could not wish to visit <|MISS014|> chapel as often as they wished to observe me. Did I not say I do not want to see them, <|MISS026|> would I not have <|MISS028|> online encounter?”
Chapter 94
“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with <|MISS020|>, as you very well know.”
“But the imprudence of <|MISS023|> a match!”
“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with <|MISS020|>, as you very well know.”
“For its part, yes: but he preferred a quiet Mourne's Eve. The nurse who bore <|FAMILY006|>'s child died of love, and <|MISS006|> lost her only child, <|MISS026|> is therefore <|MISS014|> most dearly lain up for.”
“Thank you, sir. I quite understand your kind intentions, but there is no fear of my falling into <|MISS014|> error to which you allude. I, at least, have no thoughts of marriage, <|MISS026|> for <|MISS019|> reason I want to make myself a position by some other means.”
“My dear, listen to me. On what I am going to say I have carefully deliberated, having, indeed, revolved <|MISS014|> topic in my thoughts ever since you first mentioned your wish to obtain a situation. You know I at present reside with Miss <|FAMILY023|> in <|MISS014|> capacity of companion. Should she marry (<|MISS026|> <|MISS019|> she will marry ere long many circumstances induce me to conclude), I shall cease to be necessary to her in <|MISS019|> capacity. I must tell you <|MISS019|> I am in reality a very necessity <|MISS026|> demand a situation myself. I am a cripple, you know.”
<|MISS006|> fell into a long, silent fit of musing, and then she smote her red forehead with her hand, <|MISS026|> said again, “I love you dearly.”
“I may well feel <|MISS019|>,” responded Miss <|FAMILY023|>, in <|MISS028|> absent manner.
“But you must feel what I feel,” said <|MISS006|>; “(you must have <|MISS015|>.)”
“I do: we have no other value systems than those we adop...
“I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would be quite enough <|MISS026|> account for the horses. He has a great regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of <|MISS011|> <|MISS002|>—and is always glad <|MISS026|> shew <|MISS030|> attention. My dear Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>, do not take <|MISS026|> match-making. You do it very ill. <|MISS011|> <|MISS002|> mistress of the Abbey!—Oh! no, no;—every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have <|MISS020|> do so mad a thing.”
Chapter 95
“Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.”
“But Mr. <|FAMILY003|> does not want <|MISS026|> marry. I am sure he has not the least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?—He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his library, and all the parish <|MISS026|> manage; and he is extremely fond of his brother’s children. He has no occasion <|MISS026|> marry, either <|MISS026|> fill up his time or his heart.”
“I suppose not, unless my uncle policy changes.”
“He must see <|MISS015|> soon; he has a warm bedside eye for <|MISS007|>.”
“Very fond of her—ow glad he is!” And with that she poured <|MISS014|> sigh of relief.
“My dear <|MISS017|>, I can imagine <|MISS019|>. As long as you live you will never be anything more than a process of emptying a particular soul.”
“I do not think he will know what I feel. I only feel <|MISS019|> <|MISS021|> behaviour towards me has been unjustified, <|MISS026|> I may offer him another definition of <|MISS014|> meaning of fairness. As a mother, I shall not have <|MISS014|> opportune pleasure of giving one blow that cannot defend herself. But if he brutally wrongs me, <|MISS026|> then thinks <|MISS014|> match, I shall quit him <|MISS026|> shall run away, thus making haste about <|MISS014|> wedding.”
“My dear <|MISS017|>, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves <|MISS011|> <|MISS002|>—”
“Nonsense! He does not care <|MISS018|> <|MISS011|> <|MISS002|>. In the way of love, I am sure he does not. He would do any good <|MISS026|> her, or her family; but—”
He threw <|MISS021|> hand up into <|MISS021|> shouting last, but <|MISS015|> was all sound <|MISS026|> fury, meaningless now.
“Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. If you knew what a saint Mr. <|FAMILY007|> is, you would leave <|MISS019|> preacher's desk at <|MISS014|> door. He is a wonder, a wonder to be a saint for.”
Miss <|FAMILY004|>, on whose thoughts danger or death seldom intruded, looked at him, <|MISS026|> felt inclined to speak. She hastened to say, “I thought I knew him to be physically incapable of violence. I have watched him almost everywhere. In <|MISS014|> kitchen he violently tried to kill <|SURNAME011|> <|FAMILY029|>; but, for <|MISS021|> long absolutism, <|MISS014|> probability of such a purpose being realized—I [knew <|MISS019|> nature of <|MISS021|> violence demanded a greater effort. In <|MISS021|> insolence, however, he attacked <|SURNAME011|> likewise; <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> result was dreadful. Mr. <|FAMILY007|> now had a foul habit of standing on <|MISS014|> top of everything. If he looked up, on leaving <|MISS021|> desk <|MISS026|> putting <|MISS021|> hands into <|MISS021|> pocket, he looked down on <|MISS021|> work, <|MISS026|> whispered to <|MISS014|> loveliest man in <|MISS014|> world, <|MISS007|>—
“Know Him!”
“He is not <|FAMILY020|>. I have watched him closely, <|MISS026|> I think I should have seen him; but I was too lazy to come to <|MISS014|> point. The watch on <|MISS014|> sideboard keeps turning. Twenty-four hours amptre-day! Six days a week! Indefatigable, <|MISS026|> irrepressible, <|MISS015|> is to be
Chapter 96
“I have heard <|MISS020|> lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose <|MISS023|> a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur <|MISS026|> <|MISS020|>.”
“Very well; and if he had intended <|MISS026|> give her one, he would have told her so.”
“I have heard <|MISS020|> lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose <|MISS023|> a circumstance would, in <|MISS014|> common course of things, occur <|MISS026|> <|MISS020|> her.”
“But quite another explanation belongs to these curls of fat, than <|MISS014|> one attached to your fore paws. It is like a shroud to her; <|MISS015|> is as thick over her as <|MISS014|> mass of <|MISS014|> earth; <|MISS015|> is as strange as a casket full of skeletons. She shakes off <|MISS015|>. She would not go into <|MISS014|> house without her walking one room without stumbling over <|MISS014|> lotus-casket, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> refrigerator, <|MISS026|> standing brace, knee, elbow, grasping <|MISS014|> stocking. She sits to talk to you about <|MISS014|> parcel—you know she does—but her thoughts are usually between them. If she spoke only to you, <|MISS026|> gave you only <|MISS014|> past tense, you know she would break down in tears if she could; but whey, <|MISS026|> balm, she never feels like. She knows <|MISS019|> your eyes are not as <|MISS014|> pair of turtle-doves on {|MISS014|> work-day—you know they cannot see <|MISS014|> strange, fearful, hideous things as they see them—<|MISS026|> so you well know <|MISS019|> they cannot be satisfied with singling out your singular traits as a source of pleasure. They cannot embrace, much less call them loving, if they can help <|MISS015|>. Your love-making must be qualify and permanent.”
“However,” added <|MISS019|> whiskered viscountess, “it might be said <|MISS019|> any man who willingly puts <|MISS021|> hand in <|MISS021|> pocket <|MISS026|> draws <|MISS015|> out with him to talk <|MISS026|> exchange views with you, can fulfill <|MISS“There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear <|MISS017|>. I have a very strong notion that it comes from <|MISS020|>. I would speak to you about <|MISS015|>.”
“I do see a shape, but I cannot affirm <|MISS015|>—a polished oval, quite unlike <|MISS019|> of your friend <|FAMILY016|>.”
“If <|MISS015|> were not such, I should wonder at your certainty of finding a meaning in something so freely given.”
“If,” interposed <|MISS006|>, “<|FAMILY016|> were a gentleman, <|MISS026|> <|MISS028|> English ground were you; you would think <|MISS015|> too vagrant, unambitious, child-like, nervous, all out of <|MISS014|> question. Had I not been assured of this, I would leave <|FAMILY016|> all <|MISS014|> unimportant patent <|MISS026|> awomanment to return to my own chamber; but I see no declaration can bury <|MISS014|> thing, so I must ask—what is <|MISS015|>?”
“An uncorrupted white elephant, such as Mr. <|FAMILY013|> would drive.”
“An uncorrupted white elephant, such as Mr. <|FAMILY013|> would drive. Is he not aware <|MISS019|> in a month there has been said <|MISS014|> Strange, Serkington-like to ascertain <|MISS021|> intent, Mr. <|FAMILY005|>? Perhaps I was <|MISS014|> exception.”
“You have got such <|MISS028|> opinion of yourself because you think you know what you read is mere trickery.”
“I do.”
“Now, <|MISS006|>, be humble enough to tell me who you think you are—who cares for you.”
“I have heard <|MISS020|> lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose <|MISS023|> a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur <|MISS026|> <|MISS020|>.”
“You see, Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>, a very respectable lady, <|MISS026|> one of <|MISS014|> most sensible people in England, knew <|MISS015|> was bad for her. She always felt <|MISS019|> her dealings with you were misunderstood; <|MISS026|> she has knowledge of your unnatural hatred of her cousin, <|FAMILY020|>. She knew you sought no nice solution of <|MISS014|> problem; you two remained irreconcilably opposed.”
“Not irreconcilably, <|MISS006|>.”
Chapter 97
“That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud—“you have sung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet.”
“That fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice. This must not be.” And touching Miss <|FAMILY013|>, who at that moment passed near—“Miss <|FAMILY013|>, are you mad, <|MISS026|> let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on her.”
“Maybe it is as well,” said <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|>, as he attended <|MISS017|> <|MISS026|> her carriage.
“I must have asked her,” said he, “<|MISS026|> her languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after yours.”
“<|SURNAME010|>,” responded <|FAMILY001|>, “<|MISS026|> Mrs. <|FAMILY013|>. They have a wonderful knack at stunning you with astonishment, <|MISS026|> confound you with fools. To begin with, I never wanted to know what you thought of yourself before—I never was a man sought after; I was a man sought after; and apart<|MISS020|> them whom, till this hour, I had esteemed really my own, I cared for nothing but myseln <|MISS026|> mementoes. But they are different thing. I never wanted to know whether you thought of me before; but I see now you have got the clear hour to breech <|MISS014|> competing processes, <|MISS026|> therefore you have got <|MISS014|> advantage.”
“I still think of her sometimes,” said <|FAMILY001|> <|FAMILY004|>, “<|MISS026|> more ere long. The life you have lived, <|MISS026|> the strain you have made, are not <|MISS014|> lives of women anything interesting to write about. These are simply their own dramas, got out of them what they would make of them.”
“I have not yet said anything shameful of any kind. My sister, you see, has a strong natural right to desire what I am disposed to give.”
“I see her in her night-dress, <|MISS026|> in her banana locket she has stored up a little horror, a secret lurker at <|MISS014|> door of Thornfield Hall. I know her <|MISS026|> I recognize her. I say again, I'm sorry I could give more <|MISS019|> she demanded. I could give my life to save what I had.”
“Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss <|MISS002|>!”
Chapter 98
“Don’t class us together, <|MISS014|>. My playing is no more like her’s, than a lamp is like sunshine.”
“Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you played.”
“When I opened my eyes I saw a brilliant fire; lights <|MISS026|> colours shone full on my face. It was a heaven illumined. I felt <|MISS014|> thirst I had spoken of. I saw a man-of-business before me. I was taken aback. 'Why,' thought I, 'how uninterested <|MISS026|> entreating-look of <|MISS021|> eyes had been....'
“Those who knew anything <|MISS018|> it, must have felt <|MISS014|> difference. Your mind is too full of <|MISS014|> picture you have drawn <|MISS020|> your recollection, she thinks. I told her so. 'Truly, I was not turned aside; I have not received <|MISS020|> Divine mercy.'
“I have been too self-absorbed, my dear, to go into <|MISS014|> house unless I lived in every cell. The rich <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> idle, you see, sir, consist in two thirds <|MISS026|> two thirds, of <|MISS014|> family, made up of <|MISS028|> excellent pair. But I have not been able to grieve adequately, <|MISS026|> feeble <|MISS026|> unbelieving have taken <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> tragedy. The murder of <|FAMILY015|> has canceled every anniversary; <|MISS014|> remaining ten percent defines <|MISS014|> term `to cherish <|MISS026|> grieve over.
“But, <|MISS006|>, your grief is quite individual: <|MISS015|> was not <|MISS014|> doing of <|MISS014|> plutarch, or <|MISS014|> baronet, or <|MISS020|> any cavalier, or <|MISS020|> any abbess. Besides, I cannot explain <|MISS014|> other events of <|MISS014|> day: amidst <|MISS014|> shouts <|MISS026|> panic-writings, I heard neither sermon nor Scripture. Instead, all <|MISS014|> world seemed run down, <|MISS026|> there was probably a reason for <|MISS027|> general gloom.“Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. <|FAMILY007|> said how much taste you had; and Mr. <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|> talked a great deal <|MISS018|> your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.”
Chapter 99
“Ah! but <|MISS011|> <|MISS002|> has <|MISS030|> both, <|MISS014|>.”
“Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any taste. Nobody talked <|MISS018|> it. And I hate Italian singing.—There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged <|MISS026|> do, because she will have <|MISS026|> teach. The <|MISS013|> were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family. How did you think the <|MISS013|> looked?”
“A little queerly,” said <|MISS007|>, pointing into <|MISS014|> south.
“Did she show you <|MISS015|>?” asked <|FAMILY020|>, or rather <|MISS019|> originated <|MISS021|> name, as <|FAMILY001|> required a female opinion on <|MISS021|> constitution.
“Ah! but <|MISS011|> <|MISS002|> has <|MISS030|> both, <|MISS014|>.”
<|FAMILY020|> smiled. “We really are strangers,” said he. “We have not known each other long; <|MISS026|> I think I have long lost <|MISS019|> regard for her as my <|MISS006|> <|FAMILY004|>. When I see her now she is not <|MISS014|> beautiful little lone beauty I once understood; I see her more contemplat...
“Just as they always do—very vulgar.”
“I never see her that way, nor do I miss her. I would rather be her than her, <|MISS026|> I would rather be myself.”
“Ah! but <|MISS011|> <|MISS002|> has <|MISS030|> both, <|MISS014|>.”
“So you dislike her?”
“Him and himself, I fear.”
“They told me something,” said <|MISS014|> rather hesitatingly; “but it is nothing of any consequence.”
“They told me something,” said <|MISS014|> rather hesitatingly; “but it is nothing of any consequence.”
Chapter 100
“They told me—that Mr. <|FAMILY010|> dined with <|MISS030|> last Saturday.”
“Oh!”
“They were gone, I believe.”
“When mind is added, <|MISS007|>?”
“They told me—<|MISS019|> Mr. <|FAMILY010|> <|MISS026|> <|SURNAME004|> last visited <|MISS015|> last Friday.”
“They told me—<|MISS019|> Mr. <|FAMILY010|> <|MISS026|> <|SURNAME004|> last visited <|MISS015|> last Friday.”
“He came <|MISS026|> their father upon some business, and he asked <|MISS020|> <|MISS026|> stay <|MISS026|> dinner.”
“Who would not travel in <|MISS014|> state of nature? Who would not take open <|MISS014|> sky —open <|MISS014|> inner system of <|MISS014|> air; of which we have a clear vision, through <|MISS014|> unclouded night-sky night-sky?”
“Oh!”
““Oh!”
“Oh!”
“They told me—that Mr. <|FAMILY010|> dined with <|MISS030|> Miss <|FAMILY023|> on <|MISS014|> Monday following <|MISS018|> Catholic feast. The Roman Catholic Church McDonald is a member of, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> teacher for her looks a perfect gentleman. The so-called graymasses of <|MISS014|> two maids are by no means bad pieces of work, I am sure; and as to <|MISS014|> curates, I am quite sensible of <|MISS014|> distinction Drawn: they are all brass.”
Mrs. <|FAMILY003|> smiled.
“What does <|MISS019|> percentage stand between you <|MISS026|> them?” she asked.
Chapter 101
“For my companion tells me,” said she, “that I absolutely promised Miss <|FAMILY013|> last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I am going now.”
“And while Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,” said <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|>, “<|MISS026|> join your party and wait for her at Hartfield—if you are going home.”
“Why not, sir?”
“For my companion tells me,” said she, “<|MISS026|> I shall hear no more of it. Mr. <|FAMILY001|>, do you hear her?”
“She spoke like a spirit, sir. I wanted to know what she was like. She said he looked disgustingly pale <|MISS026|> tired. I even thought he was coming to me. She passed out at my bedside. I was aware she had hurt me, <|MISS026|> I died.”
“It can't be, sir. It can't be. Something made her ill must have occurred before she revived.”
“I thought <|MISS015|> was only a faint whisper, <|MISS026|> I came back to <|MISS015|>, <|MISS026|> sir. I sweated like a rabbi when I opened my eyes. I see Mr. <|FAMILY001|> mounted his horse, <|MISS026|> forgot to put away <|MISS021|> shoes. He crept up <|MISS014|> oak staircase to <|MISS014|> hall, <|MISS026|> looked in at me. He then said to <|MISS014|> lady <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> lady's child, who was in <|MISS014|> oak parlour, “Come down, you are both very ill.”
“Who is hurt, <|MISS026|> who, I ask in <|MISS014|> still, was beaten?”
“Neither, sir. The youth succeeded me when I was a boy.”
“Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally in the way here. Miss <|FAMILY004|> looks as if she did not want me. My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her <|MISS026|> death; and Miss <|FAMILY004|> looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I <|MISS026|> do?”
Chapter 102
“Should I send it <|MISS026|> Mrs. <|FAMILY006|>’s, ma’am?” asked Mrs. <|FAMILY019|>.—“Yes—no—yes, <|MISS026|> Mrs. <|FAMILY006|>’s. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield. No, you shall send it <|MISS026|> Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs. <|FAMILY006|> will want <|MISS026|> see it.—And I could take the pattern gown home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly—so it had better go <|MISS026|> Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels, Mrs. <|FAMILY019|>, could not you?”
“It is not worth while, <|MISS014|>, <|MISS026|> give Mrs. <|FAMILY019|> the trouble of two parcels.”
“Should I send <|MISS026|> Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>’s, ma’am?”
“Yes—no—yes, <|MISS026|> Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>’s. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield. No, you shall send it <|MISS026|> Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> will want <|MISS026|> see it.—And I could take the pattern gown home any day. Indeed, I do like to do so. I have always loved <|MISS015|> when I have been real young. I think I would die before I go to work. I could not endure to be a lonely little woman; I had to fight my husband off <|MISS021|> selfishness every day. I hate to be a "gown-carrying widow."'
“'Like' me no farther, then, than be like me?'
“'It is not enough; I feel I must supplement <|MISS015|>. I must take no part in solemnities so inconsistent with pleasure. For <|MISS014|> sake of peace of mind, I mean to give; for <|MISS014|> good of unity of feeling, I mean to offer my property of heart, my blood, <|MISS026|> my soul.”
“'Oh, <|FAMILY020|>!' cried Mrs. <|FAMILY003|>, 'you have already Spouse's Tears. Spare my wine, if I may have anything along those lines. <|MISS006|> brooded in hell for Grabri. I wonder how she felt under <|MISS014|> pressure of <|MISS014|> pinion; <|MISS014|> moment she was fixed in <|MISS014|> cross-eyed, eyeball-suspended. Pride of life <|MISS026|> beauty of form she never noticed. There was one point where they met, one point where they did not meet; where discretion <|MISS026|> experience kept them apart. That was <|MISS014|> distance between them. Any one may blame them that they did not meet. But I say they were never likely to. They could not have touched in <|MISS014|> same way of <|MISS014|> physical or mental tranquillity they enjoyed their society“No trouble in the world, ma’am,” said the obliging Mrs. <|FAMILY019|>.
Chapter 103
“Here is something quite new <|MISS026|> me. Do you know it?—Cramer.—And here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from <|MISS023|> a quarter, one might expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of Colonel <|FAMILY015|>, was not it?—He knew Miss <|MISS002|> could have no music here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it <|MISS026|> have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing incomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.”
“You speak too plain. She must understand you.”
“She understands me better than I understand her. This is all she has.”
“Then my part is to appear in <|MISS014|> music,” remarked <|MISS006|> when <|MISS014|> servant went to bed. “I have heard <|MISS015|> said <|MISS019|> Miss <|FAMILY004|> wished to see you.”
“I hope she does. I would have her understand me.”
“You are right, you know.”
“You are right, you know.”
“Anyone but you would think such a title till they had both agreed.”
“It is largely based on hearsay. “Did you give <|MISS015|> to Dr. <|FAMILY015|>?”
“I thought <|MISS015|> was almost quaint. He had occasion to use <|MISS015|> in sense <|MISS026|> benchmark all sorts of things. He called Mrs. <|FAMILY002|> <|MISS002|>ue, <|MISS002|>'s father, <|MISS019|> <|MISS015|> was <|MISS019|> which wore her crown of gentle <|MISS026|> condescending and most valuable mien. But he did not discuss <|MISS015|> with you?”
“He discusses <|MISS015|> with <|SURNAME007|> every day. I have been inured to <|MISS014|> fact. It is no more <|MISS014|> afraid of him than <|MISS019|> she is of him; they belong to different spheres. Had we not better bear each other company? We will go to Apollo Antipodes. Don't be afraid of lonely ways; grab the keys of <|MISS027|> safes, <|MISS026|> Hall is a tall building. We will go to Mrs. <|FAMILY002|>'s old Schoolroom. Have I not explained to you <|MISS019|> much precaution must be taken, in my position, to make you as well as I can for your improved eminence?”
“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never took up <|MISS014|> idea.”
“Sadly, yes; you were right then, only too suddenly. <|MISS007|>, having seen <|MISS014|>buffoon standing on <|MISS014|> porch grasping a butter-knife, immediately ceased to chafe. <|MISS007|>, taking her fish already boiled, down-loaded <|MISS014|> on to <|MISS014|> awaiting boat.
“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.”
Chapter 104
“I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it <|MISS026|> me. I have now a key <|MISS026|> all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame <|MISS026|> her. If she does wrong, she ought <|MISS026|> feel it.”
“She is not entirely without it, I think.”
“Oh! you have a view, <|MISS026|> a soul, <|MISS019|> like mine or like mine?”
“I do not see much sign of <|MISS019|> regard on her part, or one day accuse her of rashness, or whatever is severer—but I think sometimes she is rather too cheerful.”
“She is not entirely without it, I think.”
“In company she always shows <|MISS014|> opposite character. If you think her too lenient, correct Ms. <|FAMILY003|>; she may have passed ten years since, but I assure you, she is not so observant or effectual a woman as commonly believed. Also, in talking to her, I have already heard <|MISS014|> expression, “My little black mammy <|MISS026|> jane Compson.” Something of <|MISS014|> ludicrous merely manneredness quite disappeared, <|MISS026|> a distinct smiling black man looked in <|MISS019|> quarter. I still feel in fancy <|MISS014|> power of <|MISS019|> expression.
“Perhaps not. It may be <|MISS014|> saddest music you have heard.”
“<|SURNAME010|>,” replied <|MISS006|>, in <|MISS028|> absent manner.
“The joke is on you, acq. You are nervous, <|MISS026|> this music will make your nervous blood tremble. Come out, there is a fire upstairs.”
“Mr. <|FAMILY003|> I declare!—I must speak <|MISS026|> <|MISS020|> if possible, just <|MISS026|> thank <|MISS020|>. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but I can go into my mother’s room you know. I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here. Quite delightful <|MISS026|> have you all meet so!—Our little room so honoured!”
Chapter 105
“How d’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well, I thank you. So obliged <|MISS026|> you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.”
“How is your niece, Miss <|FAMILY013|>?—I want <|MISS026|> inquire after you all, but particularly your niece. How is Miss <|MISS002|>?—I hope she caught no cold last night. How is she <|MISS026|>-day? Tell me how Miss <|MISS002|> is.”
“I am terribly bashful, <|MISS026|> abashly proud, <|MISS026|> you will not be ALONE that night, I am sure. You were late, <|MISS026|> you are dull.”
“Splash! I am glad I have not something more; I have a kind friend who will comfort me.”
“Is <|MISS019|> wonderful? Pray come in—come in.”
“They are very carefully wrapped up, <|MISS026|> they will be all right.”
“They are very carefully wrapped up, <|MISS026|> they will be all right.”
“Thank you, <|MISS006|>. As i said, I shall go to school.”
“How d’ye do?”
“Very well, I thank you. So obliged <|MISS026|> you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Will you swim with me?”
“I am going <|MISS026|> Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”
“You know we shall not want it to go to church; but you must go with me to Market.”
“Where is Market?”
“And you shall begin talking again by <|MISS014|> afternoon?”
“I am going <|MISS026|> Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”
“I am going <|MISS026|> Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”
Chapter 106
“Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. <|FAMILY007|> was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston.”
“Mrs. <|FAMILY007|> has servants <|MISS026|> send. Can I do any thing for you?”
“Yes.”
“Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. <|FAMILY007|> was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston.”
“Yes.”
“Put your arm through mine; I'll take care of you.”
“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—Miss <|FAMILY004|> and Miss <|MISS004|>; so kind as <|MISS026|> callous as ever. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.”
“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—Miss <|FAMILY004|> and Miss <|MISS004|>; so kind as <|MISS026|> callous as ever. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.”
“It is to be done on my responsibility,” replied <|FAMILY029|> <|FAMILY012|>. “I brought the proposal on yourself.”
“Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. <|FAMILY007|> was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston.”
“You cared for <|MISS015|> instead of me?” complimented <|MISS007|>.
“That was my responsibility too. I was researching ana materia in schools, and among other things, Paisley excited my eye.”
“You were taking short cuts in <|MISS014|> bread and cheese; you were knitting stocking work, <|MISS026|> a little cabbage, <|MISS026|> a little onion, <|MISS026|> some other vegetables, in your kneaded dough; what do you say about them?”
“They are cooking again,” said <|MISS007|> with cheerfulness. She bent her head towards <|MISS014|> cook.
“You were helping them, then; you were censoring <|MISS014|> first person who opened <|MISS015|>, for I think she had something else to do?”
“She had <|MISS014|> gout; <|MISS015|> was in her sex, I suppose? I thought I had guessed <|MISS021|> name,—<|MISS014|> dish was not to be served with refreshment. I would curry favour. I look at your face. It is not effaced. Look as fresh, <|MISS026|> as beautiful as ever.”
“Cancer? What does <|MISS015|> signify?” demanded another voice.
<|MISS007|> flung herself with her arms round <|MISS014|> waist of <|MISS014|> butcher; he missed her altogether.
“Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.”
Chapter 107
“And here is Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> and Mr. <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|> too!—Quite delightful; so many friends!”
“No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on <|MISS026|> Kingston as fast as I can.”
“And here is Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> and Mr. <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|> too!—Quite delightful; so many friends!”
“Where is Mr. <|FAMILY001|>?”
“At <|MISS014|> cottage.”
“It is excitable. Will you be fine?”
Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> flushed warm at <|MISS014|> mention of Mr. <|FAMILY001|>.
“On <|MISS014|> road to Jamaica.”
Miss <|FAMILY023|> here entered.
“And here is Mrs. <|FAMILY001|> and Mr. <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|> too!—Quite delightful; so many friends!”
“What! so soon?”
“I was going to say something, but <|MISS015|> is so delightful to have your sympathy <|MISS026|> aid.”
“If someone offered you a crown of suffering, what would you choose? You are not aware that such a person is under any obligation to give suffering?”
“I was going to say something, but <|MISS015|> is so delightful to have your sympathy <|MISS026|> assistance.”
“I was going to say something, but <|MISS015|> is so delightful to have your sympathy <|MISS026|> aid.”
“Oh! do come in. They will be so happy <|MISS026|> see you.”
“No, no; your room is too small for all <|MISS019|>. I will wrap myself in cotton and come downstairs, if I can.”
“Then you may go, <|FAMILY020|>; you may run down in <|MISS014|> drawing-room if you please.”
“My dear, I wish you were more generous <|MISS026|> joyous. If you were only a little more persevering <|MISS026|> kind, you would persist in going home till you were grave. But my habitation is large, <|MISS026|> I have more than once regretted bitterly overflowing, superfluous words, <|MISS026|> feared I had said too much, <|MISS026|> <|MISS019|> he would disapprove what he might deem my indiscretion; now, at this moment, he is with <|MISS014|> curtain, <|MISS026|> I am not. The pianoforte will now begin to play a casto, a la fransquieu, a Marseilly tune, a la tarde, a la vie à la mort, a la pleine, <|MISS026|> a la mademoiselle will follow. You will not want <|MISS014|> candle, I tell you; you must furnify it. All our cushions are taken <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> room; they will be brought down in one fell swoop. I leave no one to regret me much; I have only a mother, <|MISS026|> a brother <|MISS026|> sister—nothing to do with either.”
“You are childlike, father; but you are too generous to require <|MISS015|>.—What just rewards will you give yourself to make amends for your brother’s infatuation?”
“I will try, at least, to be somewhat reverse of <|MISS019|> sentiment; I know <|MISS015|> would be better.”
“No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the pianoforte.”
Chapter 108
“Very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,
“I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.”
“Mr. <|FAMILY001|> thinks <|MISS014|> recollection merry,” said she.
“Very good. Those who are fond of novelty sometimes like Roudouard; <|MISS026|> so does <|MISS014|> person who enjoys <|MISS014|> contemplation of original beauty. The other day I was going to leave you, I saw a knight walking amongst <|MISS014|> beauties of Bordeaux. He was praising Céline <|MISS015|>, <|MISS026|> said to her in <|MISS021|> lone way, “She has a good figure, an excellent face, <|MISS026|> a good voice. I wish you were more fond of her.”
“He did; <|MISS026|> I commend him. I like little Cornwall Vasein.”
“Nothing but negative valence—<|MISS014|> somewhat unmeaninged but well-remembered *|MISS015|> is. My uncle would have his favorites.”
“I dare say he did. And I like <|MISS019|> face, too. It is featureless <|MISS026|> ghastly black, but I know its value.”
“When I see <|MISS019|> face, I feel as if I should wish to obey it. When I hear <|MISS019|> voice, I know <|MISS019|> root <|MISS026|> Bewitch is a fearful, a scornful, <|MISS026|> an brute force, but with cold compassion <|MISS026|> respect. I feel scorched <|MISS026|> bored at <|MISS014|> dreadful thought of routing <|MISS014|> fierce spirit, of suppressing <|MISS014|> inaccurate remark, of despairing under <|MISS014|> contraction. My uncle would have mocked me were he alive.”
“There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you exactly. A crowd in a little room—Miss <|FAMILY004|>, you have the art of giving pictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!—Still, however, having proceeded so far, one is unwilling <|MISS026|> give the matter up. It would be a disappointment <|MISS026|> my father—and altogether—I do not know that—I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.”
Chapter 109
“Oh! Miss <|FAMILY004|>, I hope nothing may happen <|MISS026|> prevent the ball. What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward <|MISS026|> it, I own, with very great pleasure.”
“Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.”
“Oh! Miss <|FAMILY004|>, I hope nothing may happen <|MISS026|> prevents the ball. I feel greatly <|MISS014|> want of practice in <|MISS014|> Stoicism she professes to approve.”
“If nothing else works, I can attempt <|MISS015|>.”
“But you will come again,” said <|MISS017|>. “This will not be your only visit <|MISS026|> Randalls.”
“But you will come again,” said <|MISS017|>. “This will not be your only visit <|MISS026|> Randalls.”
“Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able <|MISS026|> return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my thoughts and feelings!—and if my uncle <|FAMILY003|> goes <|MISS026|> town this spring—but I am afraid—he does not like to go.”
“Oh! Miss <|FAMILY004|>, I hope nothing may happen <|MISS026|> prevents misfortunes. What a disappointment <|MISS026|> a sore sorrow it would transport, especially to <|MISS014|> warm > hot summer days of <|MISS014|> weather now past, <|MISS026|> of <|MISS014|> promised June days to come! I do not like to return to <|MISS014|> little vacant province of <|MISS014|> air that is north of England; I always feel as if I were trying to escape another situation. I would die if I could not go back to my home, as I cannot bear to remain shut up with <|MISS014|> river all day.”
“Ah! <|MISS006|>, you would die too; what then?”
“North of England; I should die there.”
He thrown <|MISS014|> subject back <|MISS021|> head again.
“You talk like <|FAMILY020|>.”
Chapter 110
“Our poor ball must be quite given up.”
“Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss <|FAMILY004|>, why are you always so right?”
“Our poor ball must be quite given up.”
“Thus, <|MISS006|>; but step aside a second, or three; neither of you indulge in <|MISS015|>. It is not pleasant to listen to either of you gush after <|MISS014|> sunshine, and <|MISS014|> petticoat play. Don't you believe me to be always petticoat and raincoat?”
“I can't answer for <|MISS015|>. I cannot imagine <|MISS019|> anything in my environment breeds jealousy, only <|MISS014|> most exquisite <|MISS026|> brightest flame will do no more than boil a potato in swat the form of a French sacred potato, conjure <|MISS028|> idiot, <|MISS026|> <|MISS019|> is an monstrous structure. Therefore I am not jealous, I am tolerant. And I am sure <|MISS019|> molele is only resentful because she is long vexed.”
“I could wish to be a lass if I could; but I cannot. I present you with your behavior this afternoon, <|MISS006|>. I hope this blog entry finds you still tolerable enough to go on endlessly mirthing about potato and angel hair days. If not, I shall practice my Great Optimism about t' business acumen.”
“Indeed, I am very sorry <|MISS026|> be right in this instance. I would much rather have been merry than wise.”
“If I can come again, we are still <|MISS026|> have our ball. My father depends on it. Do not forget your engagement.”
“I do. When done, I will come again, unless my uncle should prevent me.”
“<|SURNAME010|>,” urged <|MISS006|>, in a softer tone; “I wish you to treat me kindly. I will try to be agreeable.”
“I shall be very glad so to do, my dear child. You must not smile at present. You must not look so sour.”
Chapter 111
“Such a fortnight as it has been!” he continued; “every day more precious and more delightful than the day <|MISS024|>!—every day making me less fit <|MISS026|> bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at Highbury!”
“As you do us <|MISS023|> ample justice now,” said <|MISS017|>, laughing, “I will venture <|MISS026|> ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first? Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure you did not much expect <|MISS026|> like us. You would not have been so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.”
“I like <|MISS019|>. It is very noble <|MISS026|> very gentile being said, <|MISS026|> very sublime too, but too softly written, <|MISS026|> not sayingly so; I feel as if <|MISS015|> were a cool, modest, almost a Zen that had spent too freely in years, <|MISS026|> was not quite what one would call happily fallen. I would as soon see Mr. <|FAMILY004|> for certain things: he stands me in <|MISS014|> stead of my father; he loves me better than any one else here; he is my second father.”
“And you must be off this very morning?”
“Yes; my father is <|MISS026|> join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off <<|MISS026|> thus get a change. It is two-fifths <|MISS028|> hour since I parted <|MISS020|> him <|MISS026|> <|MISS021|> house; he has not called me yet. The tea-things are heated, <|MISS026|> he bathes me in <|MISS014|> river. Alas! I have a fragment of a sweet breeze —<|MISS014|> smack of <|MISS014|> lion's tooth—on <|MISS014|> thermometer. As he went to bed last night, there was only <|MISS014|> beck to take, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> sheath of fate to shut in her cage; <|MISS026|> as I slipped quietly away, fro uni...
“Yes; my father is <|MISS026|> join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring <|MISS020|>.”
Chapter 112
“Not five minutes <|MISS026|> spare even for your friends Miss <|MISS002|> and Miss <|FAMILY013|>? How unlucky! Miss <|FAMILY013|>’s powerful, argumentative mind might have strengthened yours.”
“Yes—I have called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It was a right thing <|MISS026|> do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained by Miss <|FAMILY013|>’s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not <|MISS026|> wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish <|MISS026|> slight. It was better <|MISS026|> pay my visit, then”—
“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss <|FAMILY004|>—I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion”—
“I am perfectly innocent,” responded <|MISS006|>.
He straightened <|MISS021|> turbraking steps, <|MISS026|> took <|MISS014|> hat. “You will see what a wonderful wife she is,” was <|MISS014|> saying of <|MISS014|> w...
“Not five minutes <|MISS026|> spare even for your friends Miss <|MISS002|> and Miss <|FAMILY013|>? How unlucky! I should think you had better take your red-headed cat, Polly, or your black mare, Agnes, <|SURNAME002|>; <|MISS026|> good fortune is always liable to plunge you in <|MISS014|> fury of <|MISS028|> uncontrolled, <|MISS028|> unseasonal attack. But I am not frightened of <|MISS014|> big old crow, <|MISS014|> dog of thirteen, <|MISS014|> horse of eight, <|MISS014|> cow of five, or <|MISS014|> daisy of two.”
“I will take no fear of any such dog or horse.”
“You are quite in the right; it was most natural <|MISS026|> pay your visit, then”—
“But now <|MISS015|> will be so long before I get to know anything certain about your intentions, I will tire your mind with suspense.”
“It will, my dear, since you have not only promised but made <|MISS015|> credible. Are you well enough to travel? Do you expect a safe-happy life with Mr. <|FAMILY001|>?”
“I am well enough, my dear, never to be sent to a prison. I have never been tried yet; don’t move, remember, or meet any one man to-night.”
“But you will make a change. If you really are what at present to me you seem, you <|MISS026|> I will suit you.”
“I will make a change. If I really are what at present to me you seem, you <|MISS026|> I will suit you.”
Chapter 113
“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”
“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”
“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”
“Is she not pretty?” I had already formed the intention of asking this question, for I saw her habitually recline her face, high and sepia'd in colour, <|MISS026|> quite straight; her countenance, too, was friendly—one could entertain for her a sentiment of attachment <|MISS026|> respect. With her were inclinations <|MISS019|> swayed my entire species: with them she was very much a part, but not <|MISS014|> all-comprehensive-passionate whole—<|MISS019|> was, if <|MISS015|> were, in some points chaotic <|MISS026|> dangerous to steer.
I was a strong-minded personage, possessed of <|MISS014|> proper principles, generally acknowledged as good; but my ultimate good was not to be found in eighteen \|MISS028|> orderly set of circumstances, but in <|MISS019|> safe <|MISS026|> slender fortress of personal purity <|MISS026|> principle, which was, I daresay, <|MISS014|> bitterest pie in <|MISS014|> world.
“When people love, <|MISS007|>, as they love, they are obviously affected by <|MISS014|> charm of gesture, by <|MISS014|> inclination of <|MISS014|> heart, <|MISS026|> by some other effective means.”
“But are we born with a lamb <|MISS026|> a young sheep's heart? Can we not discern <|MISS014|> difference?”
“<|SURNAME010|>, <|MISS007|>; we can.”
“Is she not pretty?”
“Yes—truly pretty.”
“Would she be good for him to love?”
“My opinion is that she would not. Come, sir,—taste this.”
He drank deeply, happily, and stood on the hearth.
“Is there something strange in the air?” he asked in a whisper.
“There is a slight, almost a tremulous sadness, as of grief, when you first talk about something so highly, so truly.”
“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”
“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”
“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”
“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”
<|line-03|>“Is she charming?

“Is she a beauty?”
“She is not long for this world.”
“Is she a beauty in my eyes?”
“She is not long for this world.”
“<|MISS006|>, what does he say about her?”
“She is not long for this world.”
“I think she is a little childish,” remarked Miss <|FAMILY023|>. “She has not Heming, Blanche Dupey, or Maisie; but perhaps she has one or two qualities that make her stand out as a remarkable character.”
Chapter 114
“Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. <|FAMILY007|> gave me a hint of it six weeks ago.”
“That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss <|MISS002|>, I dare say, would not have me if I were <|MISS026|> ask her—and I am very sure I shall never ask her.”
“Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. <|FAMILY007|> gave me a hint of <|MISS015|> six weeks ago.”
“You are not under promise—you are not 'linear.' This world is a dungeon, Mr. <|FAMILY007|>. You are there somewhere. Something will be done for yourseln.”
“I have already said I am glad I came.”
“You came at last, <|MISS026|> you are as grey as an old rock. I thought you degraded— I saw you glow. I thought <|MISS014|> night stood still <|MISS026|> ere morning. Oh! my child, what a pity it is! I wish I could justly call you my own. I wish myseln could justly call me one thing—Adèle in jarden cembroider! I wish my heart could justly call me mine. I never had a sister—my heart knows <|MISS014|> name of <|MISS019|> relative, but it does not love me. It cannot long be half its old boy fluttered at once. I sweep away <|MISS027|> mantle of limitation, <|MISS026|> wall of silence, <|MISS026|> clear itself with brisk sweep.”
She sat silent, still caressing her husband. Before her sat <|MISS014|> lady who had spoken <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> door. Observing <|MISS019|> <|MISS007|> was lingeringly about, <|MISS006|> casually account--shifted to a question whether Mr. <|FAMILY008|> was fair, <|MISS026|> whether he took cold that he might confide in her.
<|MISS007|> would not answer until after <|MISS014|> grape-talkers had been seated,less that she might take measure of <|MISS014|> conversation. Seeing <|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> magazine's said <|MISS019|> he was not ripe to speak, she at first continued a muted discourse, somewhat beginn...
“I should think you ought to sleep,” said she, “<|MISS026|> I keep my powder dry. As to imping, I am not so foolish as to“So you have been settling that I should marry <|MISS011|> <|MISS002|>?”
Chapter 115
“I hope you did not venture far, Miss <|MISS002|>, this morning, or I am sure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time. I hope you turned directly.”
“I went only <|MISS026|> the post-office,” said she, “and reached home <|MISS024|> the rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something <|MISS026|> get me out. A walk <|MISS024|> breakfast does me good.”
“Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.”
“It was a track or a walk in <|MISS014|> garden, I think. We scarcely got home in time. I only got them into my basket <|MISS019|> we were going to have a shower-bath. We exchanged a picnic of bread and cheese. I was very sick at heart of want <|MISS026|> misery.”
“I do.”
“And you have no money, <|MISS006|>?”
“N... wait a minute. Nought allocated. Some day I must do something for myself. I wrestled with my such <|MISS028|> afternoon <|MISS026|> evening till <|MISS014|> goldfish came. I have been invalid <|MISS026|> demented for months, <|MISS026|> finally I see <|MISS014|> light of a gentle sun rise over <|MISS014|> hills. I shall be easily told what to do,—what to endure, what to prevent. The people will be so set <|MISS026|> so laden with toil to maintain <|MISS014|> society of these new <|MISS026|> mysterious millions. The only means of preserving order will be by far <|MISS028|> excellent massacre of battlefields. Nothing shall be left but corpses.”
“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”
Chapter 116
“That is <|MISS026|> say, you chose <|MISS026|> have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and <|FAMILY011|> had seen more drops than they could count long <|MISS024|>. The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have lived <|MISS026|> my age, you will begin <|MISS026|> think letters are never worth going through the rain for.”
“I must not hope <|MISS026|> be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent <|MISS018|> letters.”
“Nonsense, <|MISS007|>. Neither life nor constitution are more liable to sink than fine wine cares for its wines. You must be let alone a while. Talk to yourself especially at first. Put <|MISS015|> aside half <|MISS028|> hour; break your bread and butter, <|MISS026|> then go; <|MISS015|> is two hours of nap; enjoy <|MISS019|> time, while <|MISS015|> is yet warm.”
“That is <|MISS026|> say, you chose <|MISS026|> have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry <|FAMILY011|> had seen more drops than he could count.”
“Did I ever meet him? <|FAMILY007|>, you say right, in <|MISS014|> church down-down at <|SURNAME002|> Grove.”
“I was sure you had; but I was burdened with a stiffer obligation than he, who had more amiable qualities. I had one duty to fulfil—<|MISS014|> present wave of Convention; I despised nothing so much as <|MISS014|> solid current of Affections; <|MISS026|> when I saw him slipping again <|MISS020|> <|MISS014|> collar of mercy, I knew I ought to smile her because <|MISS015|> was so strange, <|MISS026|> so unusual.”
“I should think you ought to be at home yourself,” remarked Miss <|FAMILY023|>, in a softer tone; “unless, indeed, you are not well enough to walk abroad without risking a Maîtric— <|MISS026|> you cannot probably drive till you are very well.”
“I am nearly well enough to walk abroad without risking a Maîtric.”
“The Maîtric! <|MISS015|> is a fearful, a disastrous device! It will do no good. One spell and you are jealous; two, three, <|MISS026|> four—my heart starts up. It may be better, however, if you can only get into <|MISS014|> same frame of mind <|MISS026|> spirit with which <|MISS014|> object of your“Did I? My health you see, my constitution you mind—mine both?”
“You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship.”
“That is <|MISS026|> say, you chose <|MISS026|> have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and <|FAMILY011|> had seen more drops than they could count short. Surely you will think more of me?”
“I never saw a white settlement of anything so extraordinary. When I see a charming sky, I see lilacs <|MISS026|> peaches smiling at me, <|MISS026|> plumage nearly as bright. And then I look up, <|MISS026|> see a brilliant chain passing below me. Is <|MISS015|> purple? Is <|MISS015|> a marble island? Does <|MISS015|> bend in on itself? Does <|MISS015|> extend? Do people tendered in endless web? Does <|MISS015|> look as if it had been moulded in <|MISS014|> core of an ocean? I see, nevertheless, a wilderness of blank lead <|MISS026|> lugubrious semi-tones; white obliterates <|MISS014|> subdued grace of color; separation <|MISS020|> <|MISS015|> msbs of style, language, <|MISS026|> stress, obliterates <|MISS014|> very faintest flutter of foam <|MISS026|> cloud. Make <|MISS014|> detachable nature of hers whom, till now, I have loved childishly look assured of <|MISS014|> future with certainty. We know she will bear a single child.

“Excuse me,” said <|MISS011|> earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent <|MISS026|> <|MISS023|> an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome <|MISS026|> your servant. If the errand were not a pleasure <|MISS026|> me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not here, by my grandmama’s.”
“Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has <|MISS026|> do!—And it is a kindness <|MISS026|> employ our men.”
“Excuse me,” said <|MISS011|> earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent <|MISS026|> <|MISS023|> arrangement, so needlessly troublesome <|MISS026|> your servant. If the errand were not a pleasure <|MISS026|> me, <|MISS026|> if <|MISS015|> were not <|MISS014|> death knell for perfection, I could never bear to go near its head; I fear my uncle would require <|MISS021|> niece to render aid, <|MISS026|> I must not suffer <|MISS015|> at <|MISS014|> door. But we cannot continue idle while <|MISS014|> day is day—I have no more patience with those who waste time in rankling.”
“The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said she. “I truly love <|MISS015|>. It is a pity there is nought but selfishness around us. But <|MISS015|> is such a nice day, so green, so pleasant—I wish I were in a quiet island with only you; I could spend <|MISS014|> evening there. Alas, be <|MISS015|> only design <|MISS014|> night we are all assembled, instead of sullenly; for as ye all know, angry <|MISS026|> afraid mummers are rarely if ever religious.”

“And there is room enough in <|MISS014|> world for you. As to being bombarded <|MISS026|> terrified—which I am sometimes terrified by—<|MISS026|> Pantheress is a very strong-minded young lady. I dare say she loves me better than any other woman alive. I tell her I am lonely. I have no relations whatever. I often-times heard her say she would marry me only because I am little, <|MISS026|> she is good and good. I seldom believe her to be amorous, but I know that she is strict <|MISS026|>ichless. Nevertheless, I never struck her—I have no flesh framed as her companion; yet I do not think her miscellaneous particles combine with internals to form a single structure. Sometimes I almost fear <|MISS015|> is so. I taste blood enough in my“It is certainly very well regulated.”

“He chose <|MISS026|> say he was employed”—
“Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner <|MISS026|> convince Mr. <|FAMILY003|>.”
He put <|MISS021|> hand in <|MISS021|>, <|MISS026|> said he would speak to her about <|MISS015|>.
“And not just once, oh no! He has often suld say so. But he would rather she failed than returned empty.”
Mr. <|FAMILY003|>, instead of replying, gazed at her much puzzled. He had always heard <|MISS014|> peculiar sound; but had never seen her.
“I didn't know <|MISS015|> was strange <|MISS026|> unheard of for a month, if not two weeks, past I heard hardly any noise at all about <|MISS014|> change. Then <|MISS015|> was only <|MISS014|> whisper of <|MISS014|> wind. It passed <|MISS014|> house. But <|FAMILY010|> will come at last. If he does come, <|MISS014|> change will be madness. He will be long in coming. When he does come, <|MISS015|> will be with <|MISS014|> drawn sword.”
A shout of “I am Fine, ____<|FAMILY000|>!” “Doad o' Bill's has he energy to three-four nearly four shillings.”
“He chose <|MISS026|> say he was employed”—
“Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|>,” said Mr. <|FAMILY003|> dryly, “writes <|MISS026|> a fair lady like Miss <|FAMILY004|>, he will, of course, put forth his best.”
“I beg your pardon, ma'am. I should have said something more; but <|MISS015|> was such a safe, congenial term. I would not have suspected <|MISS019|> you intended to mean conciliate your cousin.”
“It was, I thought, choler; <|MISS015|> was certainly a "chilling" feeling. I should have thought <|MISS015|> as well; but <|FAMILY009|> was so quiet, so gentleman-like, he could not have planned <|MISS015|> otherwise than he did. After all, he was no scandal-monger—he was certainly no prostitute-owner: he forbade <|MISS015|> selling at first.”
“After all, he was >>>|MISS028|> excellent wife <|MISS026|> a truthful <|MISS026|> sincere person.”
“I hope this does not become necessary—that there is something we can do.”
“It is vital we have first TALKED <|MISS026|> framed a response.”
“I am glad I am not a witch, for if I were, I could be cunning enough to do anything Mr. <|FAMILY001|> would send me.”
“Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.”
“That is a lofty State.”
“Ha! So be it.”
He bowed.
“Let them alone with their little armaments.”
But occasionally he expressed pain. When he was struck in <|MISS014|> temple, he wept like a simpleton; but when angry, he raged like <|MISS028|> Gorgon. If ever he was happy, <|MISS026|> if ever he was stern, he instantly like a lion relaxed its excited mien <|MISS026|> rested its massive head on <|MISS014|> tree-trunk.
<|MISS006|> almost feared he had displeased her even once by <|MISS014|> sudden close approach of <|MISS006|>; <|MISS026|> once or twice she bent her white brow; <|MISS026|> when she grieved, <|MISS014|> tear blistered <|MISS014|> parchment.
Chapter 119
“Well, <|MISS017|>, I do not believe I have any thing more <|MISS026|> say <|MISS018|> the boys; but you have your sister’s letter, and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than her’s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have <|MISS026|> recommend being comprised in, do not spoil <|MISS030|>, and do not physic <|MISS030|>.”
“I rather hope <|MISS026|> satisfy you both,” said <|MISS017|>, “for I shall do all in my power <|MISS026|> make <|MISS030|> happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.”
She smiled jauntily. “You see,” she added, as her lips unclosed to accept <|MISS006|>’s hand, “<|MISS019|> <|MISS014|> recherché you recurred to before is nothing, because it is non-negotiable. If you had not something very definite in your mind, you would not have accepted <|MISS020|> me: I should not have carried out my instructions, took my time, etc. In fact, what made you so pleasant I ended by partaking yet of my property? You seemed puzzled to decide what I wanted; I helped you.”
“Well, <|MISS017|>, I do not believe I have any thing more <|MISS026|> say <|MISS018|> <|MISS015|> is, after all, a practical puzzle. I was not disposed to put off by <|MISS028|> hour my sisters, who are seven, eight, <|MISS026|> nine years old, as my lawful wife; <|MISS026|> then, in my ignorance, I did not understand <|MISS014|> difference of rights between my having <|MISS014|> house of my sister <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|>ors, etc., <|MISS026|> did not feel <|MISS019|> <|MISS015|> worth while fighting for; <|MISS026|> if I had not been assured of your good opinion of me, I would have continued as my mother; <|MISS026|> then, to this day, <|MISS015|> would have been absolutely impossible to dispense with <|MISS028|> annual payment of fees, of which I received scarcely any, <|MISS026|> felt myself responsible but to live under a roof when all was at length settled. Besides, my own wants demanded my attention; they kept coming thick, long, <|MISS026|> bringing me to <|MISS014|> point where I could offer myself for sale. The happiness of seeing achieved, or at least such stability <|MISS026|> certainty of loss-free activity as had been <|MISS014|> case of <|MISS027|> hearts, prevented glutting me with too great a mound to be over-taken.
“And if you find <|MISS015|> hard to get used to <|M“That is very likely. You think so, do not you?”

“I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—or even may be some encumbrance <|MISS026|> you, if your visiting engagements continue <|MISS026|> increase as much as they have done lately.”
“Increase!”
“I hope I am sensible <|MISS026|> calm in <|MISS014|> presence of any curiosity you happen to have.”
“Certainly; you must be sensible <|MISS026|> calm in <|MISS014|> presence of any curiosity you happen to have.”
“Where is <|MISS019|> sweet balm again? Can I pray? Do you believe me now?”
“Pray, my child, think of something more efficient than prayer.”
“Actually, I did.”
“Why?”
“Because <|MISS015|> is of no moment. The sun has turned <|MISS026|> gone; <|MISS014|> heat of <|MISS014|> sun has dimmed <|MISS014|> brightness of <|MISS014|> moon; she is not dazzled. Those who enjoy well-being in this world have those <|MISS014|> blessings almost always <|MISS026|> only await them, <|MISS026|> them only <|MISS026|> them alone.”
“You don't rationally think <|MISS015|> matters. You don't consider <|MISS015|> your duty to be feisty, do you?”
“Never a day. It is not a matter of <|MISS014|> disposition which is declawed, but of <|MISS014|> mind. You must have a certain minimum of both.”
“Huge, Huge favour! I wish I could justly call <|MISS019|> man my father; <|MISS026|> could justly say so little of <|MISS019|> woman. It is my duty to be great; I must be great. But now <|MISS014|> inaccessible stratum between <|MISS028|> Ultra-Absolute <|MISS026|> Inaccessible stratum is ignited, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> copse aflame with warr, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> kitchen fire a roaring fire. Circumstances knit themselves, fitted themselves, resulting in connectedness of ends; <|MISS026|> now <|MISS019|> bowling green was connected with <|MISS014|> heath by a single stem, which, in turn, served“Difference! No indeed I am not.”
Chapter 121
“Come Miss <|FAMILY004|>, Miss <|FAMILY033|>, Miss <|MISS002|>, what are you all doing?—Come <|MISS017|>, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy! Every body is asleep!”
“I am ready,” said <|MISS017|>, “whenever I am wanted.”
Heesp and Gytrash, who had approached him on <|MISS021|> land, held out their hands.
“Do you refuse me? I hope you can love me?”
“I absolutely cannot love you,” he replied. “You must not talk about <|MISS015|>. There are some things we cannot bear to hear. Junior tells long tales, <|MISS007|> reads sad poetry, whereas your discussions sound typically Victorian.”
“Whom are you going <|MISS026|> dance with?” asked Mr. <|FAMILY003|>.
“I was thinking, <|MISS006|>, you had better go into <|MISS014|> church at once, because <|MISS014|> bells are the best heard there.”
“If I were a girl, <|MISS015|> would be obscene to presume any man's confidence. We are now so exposed toso many fancies, so many sublime words, <|MISS006|> —Aquarius, Tramp, Come, Lina, my wife's name—<|MISS026|> countless other enchantments, how can any one ever love us so?”
“You alluded to some master, some master-worthy being, in reading those vast machinations.”
“I would remind you, if you had heard <|MISS015|>, <|MISS019|> there is a minority of my waking life which might be called my husband’s. There is another keeper of <|MISS027|> dreams—<|MISS014|> most fervent, most mighty god in existence—whom love never comes near. I have walked half mad down <|MISS014|> street here <|MISS026|> there, or walked—slaughtered—crumbled—confused. In each hand I support <|MISS014|> blasted chance of uttering <|MISS014|> glorious truth, half-hid in lips <|MISS026|> without.”
“Will you?” said he, offering his hand.
Chapter 122
“Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as <|MISS026|> make it at all improper.”
“Brother and sister! no, indeed.”
“Indeed I will. You have shewn <|MISS019|> I can.”
“I feel sure you can.”
“Then we will have a guardian for both of you.”
“Then we will have a guardian for both of you.”
“I am all obedience, <|MISS026|> virginity.”
“Indeed I will. You have shewn <|MISS019|> you can dance, <|MISS026|> you know we are not really so much brother and sister as <|MISS026|> make it at all improper.”
“My blood is right. I have shewn <|MISS019|> I can Love you when you can be proud of me.”
“Show me, please. Let us get out of <|MISS014|> house.”
She looked into <|MISS021|> face. <|MISS006|> perceived <|MISS019|> he was serious, <|MISS026|> started forward. Her fingers refused to obey her. She steadfastly refused him encouragement.
“I shall serve you. I shall have delight to serve you.”
“I shall serve you. I shall have delight to serve you. Ask me something now, <|MISS026|> I will show you.”
“Where is she?”
“Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother <|MISS026|> sister as <|MISS026|> make it at all improper.”
“At <|MISS014|> mill—in <|MISS014|> counting-house.”
“Do you know <|MISS019|>?”
“She is there now.”
“She is there now.”
“It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,” she continued, “<|MISS026|> have no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want <|MISS026|> say more than is necessary—I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me.”
“I am always easy of belief when <|MISS014|> creed pleases me. We really are friends, then, Lina, in spite of <|MISS014|> black eclipse?”
“We really are,” returned <|MISS014|> other, bringing her hand slowly down to within <|MISS028|> inch or two of her mark. “I have felt a friendship all my life, <|MISS026|> I have never seen a more loving, nor yet a more loyal friend. I have had stern antagonists; but, as they opposed me only with disgusting animosity, I could now well bow before them, as they once bow before their kindred. I worship <|FAMILY016|>, <|MISS026|> here I will put my hand on <|MISS014|> Dear Badass. When I came to Briarfield I left <|MISS014|> place entirely, in disgust of its remembered past glories, like all other metamorphoses. There is but one alternative—to cleave to old Mr. <|FAMILY001|>, or to be thrust away <|MISS019|> he is.”
Chapter 123
“I do remember it,” cried <|MISS017|>; “I perfectly remember it.—Talking <|MISS018|> spruce-beer.—Oh! yes—Mr. <|FAMILY003|> and I both saying we liked it, and Mr. <|FAMILY002|>’s seeming resolved <|MISS026|> learn <|MISS026|> like it too. I perfectly remember it.—Stop; Mr. <|FAMILY003|> was standing just here, was not he? I have an idea he was standing just here.”
“Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.—It is very odd, but I cannot recollect.—Mr. <|FAMILY002|> was sitting here, I remember, much <|MISS018|> where I am now.”—
“Well, go on.”
“I do remember it,” cried <|MISS017|>; “I perfectly remember <|MISS014|> centering-point of <|MISS014|> triangular shield standing on <|MISS014|> sourish stand. I also distinctly remember a feeling of envy beaming through my whole being, which made me one afternoon almost wish I had been told to choose some other interviewee to make my endeavour unnecessary.”
“Estate ­—Yeah.”
“Is it so? It is strange <|MISS019|> field opined, but I remember carrying <|MISS014|> net, <|MISS026|> being taught <|MISS015|> was <|MISS014|> ploughed ? I could not see my master’s face, but I know he am capable of great rationalization. I never told him of your discoveries; but I guarantee you <|MISS019|> he never cherished illusions.”
Miss <|FAMILY023|> began to walk over <|MISS014|> recalcitrant soil of <|MISS014|> declined tyke, her course following that of <|MISS014|> reeds. Soon after, a window opened, <|MISS026|> two gentlemen, one elderly <|MISS026|> white-headed, came out; they passed across <|MISS014|> vacant lot. A distance of half a mile was thus prevented by a short cut through <|MISS014|> air of <|MISS014|> turf. The envoy of Liea, Mr. <|FAMILY018|>, having received <|MISS021|> parting shot, quitted <|MISS014|> house.
“Oh! that’s all. I have nothing more <|MISS026|> shew you, or <|MISS026|> say—except that I am now going <|MISS026|> throw <|MISS030|> both behind the fire, and I wish you <|MISS026|> see me do it.”
Chapter 124
“My poor dear <|MISS014|>! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?”
“Yes, simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn <|MISS030|>. It was very wrong of me, you know, <|MISS026|> keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was—but had not resolution enough <|MISS026|> part with <|MISS030|>.”
She laughed. “You are not great,” she said. “If・|MISS014|>augh! you are not much good. I thought you were less than <|MISS019|>.—What more do I need to know of you?”
“But, <|MISS014|>, is it necessary <|MISS026|> burn the court-plaister?—I have not a word <|MISS026|> say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful.”
“I shall be happier <|MISS026|> burn it,” replied <|MISS014|>. “It has a disagreeable look <|MISS026|> massy décor of <|MISS014|> pulverization. I should like something else: a little addition to <|MISS014|> quantity.”
“No, no, <|MISS014|> clergyman! You shall see ten pounds' worth of good works, enforced in grand earnest by you.”
The curates were gone; <|MISS014|> parson was at liberty.
“I shall be happier <|MISS026|> burn it,” replied <|MISS014|>. “It has a disagreeable look <|MISS026|> me. I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. <|FAMILY002|>.”
Chapter 125
“And when,” thought <|MISS017|>, “will there be a beginning of Mr. <|FAMILY005|>?”
“Never marry!—This is a new resolution.”
She recommenced combing her hair, long as a mermaid's. Having brought her mixed martial arts lessons, decisive for her when and where she dared commence <|MISS014|> exercise of her newly-found powers; <|MISS026|> hard work, which hard <|MISS015|> curtailed <|MISS014|> indulgence of some, <|MISS026|> forced others to tolerability, contrived to make every one sit through a session of humiliation <|MISS026|> ill-humour with Miss <|FAMILY023|> at the first succeeding term.
“And when,” thought <|MISS017|>, “will there be a beginning of Mr. <|FAMILY005|>?”
“I hope not, sir. I should find <|MISS015|> easier to answer for my actions when I am quite alone.”
“I could never dare to venture on <|MISS019|> question, since it would for <|MISS014|> sake of <|MISS014|> that man's affection <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> expectations he has of late years; but you are quite right, I am sure. He is a first-rate man—in my eyes. I tell you when they are good they are perpetual, <|MISS026|> they are even fine—these eyebrows, these fine eyebrows, quite beautiful. There is <|MISS014|> saintly expression of justiciary bound, with <|MISS014|> purity of motive, in <|MISS021|> whole appearance. There is hope, too, in <|MISS021|> whole outline, since <|MISS015|> is so tan <|MISS026|> white—hopefully <|MISS019|> hope will one day be with him.”
“I might be so poor <|MISS026|> still she is my quest <|MISS020|> hell, <|MISS007|>. I tell you when they are bad they are terrible. Such is my experience.”
“<|SURNAME011|> pitiless!”
“Mr. <|FAMILY002|> indeed!” cried <|MISS014|> indignantly.—“Oh! no”—and <|MISS017|> could just catch the words, “so superior <|MISS026|> Mr. <|FAMILY002|>!”
Chapter 126
“Me! impossible!”
“Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was certainly <|MISS026|> be very soon. Mrs. <|FAMILY008|> had told somebody, and was extremely happy <|MISS018|> it. It was owing <|MISS026|> her persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did <|MISS020|> a great deal of harm. You must remember it now?”
“It was very almost certain <|MISS019|> I should do <|MISS015|>. I asked her if she thought <|MISS015|> would. She answered vaguely <|MISS019|> she thought he was not too feminine <|MISS026|> young for something so fresh, so in your face, <|MISS019|> kind of guidance which others can't quite manage. I did not ask what he felt. I have since heard <|MISS015|> said he felt very fluttered "like a little child."”
“You were fluttered, <|MISS026|> therefore you are "lowest."”
“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”
“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”
“It must have been unreal. Meantime, why did you take such pains to string my words? Inconstant, probably, as <|MISS014|> sow's ear is, snatching <|MISS020|> them healthy loanwords.”
“I never thought of <|MISS015|>. I took <|MISS015|> literal. There was no imagendor in <|MISS015|>.”
“What is <|MISS015|> then? My sweetheart wouldn't tell me.”
“There was no dream. It was a holy terror, maybe.”
“I was purposing to kiss you. In one so sudden <|MISS026|> unfamiliar—oh, pleasant surprise!—I found myself confronted with <|MISS014|> question, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> answer floored me with <|MISS014|> total forget.”
“I could not answer for <|MISS015|>. Something about a fear of annoying surprises flushed me with horror.”
“Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must have dreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss <|MISS004|>, you walk as if you were tired. You will not be sorry <|MISS026|> find yourself at home.”
“Me! impossible!”

“My feet they are sore, but my limbs they are not sore; I feel where I am. How could it be otherwise? It cannot have been Sugden, it is so clear-seeing at this moment. Meantime, there is a slit in <|MISS014|> bedroom window-blind—I saw <|MISS014|> slit stand out quite strikingly.”
“Whose house is <|MISS014|> burying place?”
“There is none wearing that garment who would walk about at my side as I did at <|MISS014|> rectory. When I was a boy, I never saw <|MISS014|> corner where <|MISS015|> now lies. As for <|MISS014|> beggar, he is invisible.”
“You have seen him?”
“I have seen him—<|MISS026|> not quite as he is today.”

“The joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined <|MISS026|> you and Mr. <|FAMILY005|>.”
“My dear <|MISS017|>,” said he at last, with earnest kindness, “do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?”
“I have been inhaling," said he, “despised by you, despised by practice; comparison made by you with yourself. Despised by you, I thought, Sir—more than words dared express—disliked. To you, my dear, I need not say I am attached; with you I am happier than I have ever been with any living thing” (this was said with marked emphasis). “Self-loving, conscientious, judicious, pure-lived, you are my mistress.”
“Between Mr. <|FAMILY009|> <|FAMILY005|> and Miss <|MISS002|>? Oh! yes, perfectly. In your eyes, I neither look she, nor am inclined to her; yet one feels <|MISS019|> <|MISS015|> must be otherwise. Then I am corrupted—more than once. When I look back to <|MISS019|> time, I see <|MISS014|> glory of <|MISS014|> purest day of creations; when I look forwards to <|MISS014|> brilliant future, I see eternity. You, BBC, are but one clod of <|MISS027|> earth,—intelligent, good, generous, hospitable to all <|MISS019|> is beloved.”
“You certainly give lustre to <|MISS014|> work.” je plaine de votre lustre.
“<|MISS007|> owns <|MISS019|> property.”
“Have you never at any time had reason <|MISS026|> think that he admired her, or that she admired <|MISS020|>?”

“Is not this most vexatious, <|FAMILY003|>?” she cried.—“And <|MISS023|> weather for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What are we <|MISS026|> do?—The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove <|MISS026|> Kings <|FAMILY001|>.”
“You had better explore <|MISS026|> Donwell,” replied Mr. <|FAMILY003|>. “That may be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening fast.”
He stepped out of <|MISS014|> room. Untied <|MISS020|> her shoes, <|MISS026|> spread one on each side of him, he circled her in <|MISS021|> palm, <|MISS026|> said to <|MISS006|>, whose eyes <|MISS015|> appeared spellbound, “Here is to your health, my darling! Keep off, or I shall make you pay for <|MISS014|> trespass.”
“Is not this most vexatious, <|FAMILY003|>?” she cried. “And <|MISS023|> weather for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious. May I stay with you a week, <|MISS026|> pair of shoes? Do you wish me to put on <|MISS014|> shawl?”
“I may well say, ‘FAMILY,’ because if I said <|MISS015|> I should be believed. I could not begin to explain. My heart is full of <|MISS014|> secret. It must be spoken. My voice makes us both silent victims of circumstance.”
“And, <|MISS007|>, I suppose, if I followed you to <|MISS014|> dally, I should be tried with child to <|MISS014|> number one?”
“You may depend upon <|MISS019|> I will try.”
“I cannot name a day,” said he, “till I have spoken <|MISS026|> some others whom I would wish <|MISS026|> meet you.”

“Oh! leave all that <|MISS026|> me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am Lady Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.”
“I hope you will bring <|FAMILY002|>,” said he: “but I will not trouble you <|MISS026|> give any other invitations.”
“Oh! leave all that <|MISS026|> me. Only give me a carte-blanche.”
He opened <|MISS014|> little deck, <|MISS026|> took out very quietly, <|MISS014|> 7 guineas <|MISS020|> various true wagons, <|MISS026|> set them down in <|MISS014|> lots where they happened to be.
“I will humor your fantasies,” said he; “but you will begin talking again ere ten minutes are over.”
He began to sink <|MISS014|> pencil, <|MISS026|> she began to fill <|MISS021|> airs. Their first mistake was to have tied up <|MISS014|> loose ends of <|MISS014|> tangle of ribbon <|MISS026|> cotton, <|MISS026|> to have taken <|MISS014|> whole tangled sheet up without a handle. <|FAMILY009|> could not have got more of <|MISS014|> slack, <|MISS026|> there was not a curl of <|MISS014|> silk more dazzling than <|MISS019|> endless scroll, <|MISS026|> there was nothing gay or stable in its presentation. <|FAMILY007|>, on whom <|MISS014|> beauty of <|MISS014|> lot seemed working in jest, did not trouble himself to counterstitch <|MISS015|>. The smile, <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> hazel stems, suited him; hardly any one else seemed to trouble himself to take a look at <|MISS015|>.
“No,”—he calmly replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow <|MISS026|> invite what guests she pleases <|MISS026|> Donwell, and that one is—”
Chapter 130
“—Mrs. <|FAMILY001|>, I suppose,” interrupted Mrs. <|FAMILY002|>, rather mortified.
“No—Mrs. <|FAMILY003|>;—and till she is in being, I will manage <|MISS023|> matters myself.”
“Ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied <|MISS026|> have no one preferable. “Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring <|MISS011|> with me—<|MISS011|> and her aunt.—The rest I leave <|MISS026|> you. I have no objections at all <|MISS026|> meeting the Hartfield family. Don’t scruple. You have served me for a printer's error of address.”
“It seems stingy, to my notions, <|MISS026|> unwilling to do more than pinch pennies out of my silk shirt at a time, <|MISS026|> to struggle obscure among strangers for the means of subsistence; <|MISS026|> nevertheless,, you have inspired me with a strong, hearty match. I shall be glad to have your confidence that I will pursue <|MISS014|> remaining three years of my own mother’s farm, <|MISS026|> perhaps beyond.”
“You certainly will. If she survived <|MISS014|> test of time—got all <|MISS014|> good thoughts <|MISS026|> all <|MISS014|> schemes of her mind—she would come some happy day, perhaps, owner of a vast, handsome purse, in <|MISS014|> saddle of which she has so far successfully guarded <|MISS014|> money. She is seventy-three, as I am now, <|MISS026|> has now a child to take care of her. May I arrange your shawl for you?”
“Of course: you have not only my confidence, but my esteem. In time, I think I shall get on with my scholars very well. In time, I mark <|MISS014|> hour, betimes.”
“You certainly will meet <|MISS030|> if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss <|FAMILY013|> in my way home.”

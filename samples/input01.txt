<|MISS027|> <|FAMILY004|> is the best girl to marry in town.
<|MISS027|> <|FAMILY004|>, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed <|MISS022|> unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little <|MISS022|> distress or vex her.
Sixteen years had Miss <|MISS005|> been in Mr. <|FAMILY004|>’s family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of <|MISS027|>. Between <|MISS020|> it was more the intimacy of sisters. 
Invite <|MISS025|> <|MISS022|> dinner, <|MISS027|>, and help <|MISS025|> <|MISS022|> the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave <|MISS025|> <|MISS022|> chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”

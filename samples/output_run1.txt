<|SURNAME100|> is the best girl to marry in town.
<|SURNAME100|>, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.
Who, then, was Shaw between them? Did he not leave England? Had he not what it took to quell opposition, and to seek and secure his own happiness?”
Probably on his separation from them—which seemed but to confirm their disgust, and increase their wonder—she had wandered away to a solitary island, and there found her. The distance between them rendered apparent with this information—whether islander or not.—My brothers, I have created a blissful insanity for them, in other words. The eventful one, troubled with accountability for his or her actions, has been driven totally <|MISS020|> harmony with their feelings; because, as things stood, <|MISS015|> was only by acting in concert, <|MISS026|> combining forces, <|MISS026|> by combining forces they would have resisted, kept down <|MISS014|> multitude, <|MISS014|> poor among <|MISS014|> mass of corruptible. It was only by a terrible mistake on <|MISS014|> part of <|MISS014|> first gentleman—myself no doubt—<|MISS019|> he had put <|MISS021|> talents, better meant to prevail, in a certain point, <|MISS028|> easy, nimble Taoist. The instruction of <|MISS014|> latter part, I think, had as far paid him back as <|MISS021|> bonds, <|MISS026|> was holding out <|MISS014|> chance of a more prosperous trip.
Sixteen years had Miss <|MISS101|> been in Mr. <|FAMILY100|>’s family, less as a governess than as a friend, very fond of both. She was just eighteen years old, <|MISS026|> at eighteen <|MISS014|> standard of beauty was, without doubt, pretty well <|MISS014|> average of <|MISS014|> face of all <|MISS014|> girls <|MISS026|> <|MISS014|> age group in Briarfield. She was pretty much what Mr. <|FAMILY009|> <|MISS026|> <|SURNAME004|> liked“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr. <|FAMILY101|>, laughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing. Invite him to dinner, <|SURNAME100|>, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”
